                        <p class="graycopy"> The year 1996 marked a breakthrough 
                          in our understanding of the benefits of physical activity 
                          and health for all Americans. With the publication of 
                          the first Surgeon General&#146;s Report on Physical 
                          Activity and Health, we have clearly documented the 
                          fact that men and women of all ages can improve the 
                          quality of their lives through a lifelong practice of 
                          regular moderate physical activity. And the research 
                          indicates that physical activity need not be strenuous 
                          to achieve real health benefits. A regular, preferably 
                          daily routine of at least 30-45 minutes of brisk walking, 
                          bicycling, or even dancing will reduce the risks of 
                          developing coronary heart disease, hypertension, colon 
                          cancer, and diabetes. Moreover, regular physical activity 
                          can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety; help 
                          control weight; and help build and maintain healthy 
                          bones, muscles and joints. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Childhood and adolescence are critical 
                          times to lay the foundation for lifelong physical activity, 
                          but, unfortunately, too many young people, especially 
                          girls, are not active enough. As children grow into 
                          adolescence, their participation in physical activity 
                          declines dramatically. As the Surgeon General&#146;s 
                          report tells us, almost half our young people aged 12 
                          to 21 are not vigorously active on a regular basis and 
                          14 percent are completely inactive. And young females 
                          are twice as likely to be inactive as young males. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> These are dangerous trends, and we 
                          need to change them. Fortunately, this landmark report 
                          on Physical Activity &#38; Sport in the Lives of Girls 
                          from the President&#146;s Council on Physical Fitness 
                          and Sports tells us some of the steps we can take to 
                          enable girls to reach their full potential. It tells 
                          us that we need to provide more quality school-based 
                          physical education for girls. It tells us that we need 
                          to encourage girls to get involved in sport and physical 
                          activity at an early age. It tells us that we need to 
                          challenge stereotypes that impede girls&#146; participation 
                          in sports. And it tells us that we have made progress 
                          in some areas. For example, the Title IX legislation 
                          enacted in 1972 has opened the doors for millions of 
                          girls to participate in school sports. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Americans took enormous pride in 
                          the accomplishments of the 1996 Olympic gold medal female 
                          athletes in soccer, softball, swimming, track and field, 
                          gymnastics, basketball, and other sports. We need to 
                          build on that spirit and develop a national commitment 
                          to ensure that every girl receives the encouragement, 
                          training, and support she needs to develop and maintain 
                          an active lifestyle. Increasing physical activity among 
                          girls is a formidable public health challenge, but the 
                          potential rewards are great: a more vigorous nation, 
                          better health and greater leadership opportunities for 
                          girls, prevention of premature death and unnecessary 
                          illness, and a higher quality of life for our citizens. 
                          I strongly encourage all Americans to join us in this 
                          effort.

                        <p class="graycopy"> In the summer of 1996, our nation 
                          cheered the performance and achievements of the U.S. 
                          women Olympians and Paralympians. The images of strong, 
                          active women were inspiring, a long way from the days 
                          when females were relegated to &#147;lady-like&#148; 
                          sports and young girls were left on the sidelines as 
                          their brothers played. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Following on the heels of the Surgeon 
                          General&#146;s Report on Physical Activity and Health, 
                          this landmark review makes clear that participation 
                          in physical activity and sport can help girls weather 
                          the storms of adolescence and lay the foundation for 
                          a healthier adult life. The report looks at &#147;the 
                          complete girl&#148; through an interdisciplinary approach 
                          to investigate the impact of physical activity and sport 
                          participation. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The conclusions are striking: regular 
                          physical activity can reduce girls&#146; risk of many 
                          of the chronic diseases of adulthood; female athletes 
                          do better academically and have lower school drop-out 
                          rates than their nonathletic counterparts; and, regular 
                          physical activity can enhance girls&#146; mental health, 
                          reducing symptoms of stress and depression and improving 
                          self-esteem. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> But further vigilance and research 
                          are needed to ensure that all girls and boys can experience 
                          these same benefits. While Title IX has a tremendous 
                          impact on expanding physical activity opportunities 
                          for females, its compliance and enforcement have often 
                          wavered. Parents, teachers, and coaches should be encouraged 
                          to challenge stereotypes about girls&#146; participation 
                          in physical activity and sport. There is a lack of information 
                          and research about how race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic 
                          status might affect girls&#146; sport and fitness involvement. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> I greatly appreciate the support 
                          of the Members of the President&#146;s Council for this 
                          endeavor, which stemmed from the Council&#146;s Task 
                          Force on Girls and Minorities. Their enthusiasm and 
                          unflinching support for expanding the reach of the PCPFS 
                          into important areas such as this have been critical 
                          to the successful completion of this important project.

                          to this report and for her many years of leadership 
                          in promoting opportunities in physical activity and 
                          sports for girls and women. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> I would like to thank the Center

                          serve as a catalyst for parents, coaches, educators, 
                          researchers, and community leaders to encourage and 
                          create opportunities for girls and young women to become&#151; 
                          and remain&#151;more physically active throughout their 
                          lives.

                        <p class="graycopy"> On behalf of the President&#146;s 
                          Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, we are honored 
                          to present this research report. All of us who have 
                          been involved with the project have a great respect 
                          for the power that sport and physical activity can wield. 
                          Such involvement has helped shape our lives. In fact, 
                          it is a major reason why many of us have chosen this 
                          area as our life&#146;s work. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Physical Activity and Sport in the 
                          Lives of Girls: Physical and Mental Health Dimensions 
                          from an Interdisciplinary Approach was created to highlight 
                          the multiplicity of ways in which physical activity 
                          and sport have become an integral part of girls&#146; 
                          lives. It examines the benefits girls derive from participation 
                          in physical activity and sport; the barriers that prevent 
                          them from reaching their full potential; and the kinds 
                          of environments in which girls learn how to develop 
                          and foster the best parts of themselves both on and 
                          off the playing fields. The report was also created 
                          to develop future research paths and policy recommendations 
                          as a guide for planning and programming. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> This is a groundbreaking report because 
                          it marks the first time an interdisciplinary approach 
                          has been used in a government document that examines 
                          the impact of sport and physical activity in the lives 
                          of girls. We have chosen authors who are experts in 
                          the physiological, sociological, psychological and mental 
                          health fields to each write a section discussing significant 
                          issues in their respective academic areas. The interdisciplinary 
                          approach is particularly important because it enables 
                          us to talk about the &#147;complete girl&#148;&#151;her 
                          social, physical, emotional and cultural environment&#151;rather 
                          than just one aspect of a girl&#146;s experience. It 
                          should be noted that, on occasion within the report, 
                          the authors present differing points of view with respect 
                          to certain research findings. For example, scientific 
                          studies in the mental health field may suggest a particular 
                          relationship between self-esteem and physical activity 
                          that has not been identified in the area of sport sociology. 
                          This should not be interpreted as problematic or contradictory; 
                          instead, it can be viewed as an opportunity for further 
                          discussion and for reinforcement of the need for future 
                          interdisciplinary research. Finally, one strength of 
                          this report is a reference list that includes numerous 
                          citations from a variety of academic disciplines. Such 
                          a list can be an invaluable resource for academics, 
                          educators and practitioners. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Related to the issue of interdisciplinarity, 
                          you will find when reading the report that different 
                          authors use different terminology when talking about 
                          girls. As a general rule, however, the word &#147;girl&#148; 
                          is used when authors are referring to girls 18 and under. 
                          Other terminology is used to further delineate age. 
                          For example, &#147;adolescent female&#148; typically 
                          refers to girls between the ages of 13-18, while &#147;young 
                          girl&#148; generally signifies 11 and under. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> While the amount of research covered 
                          in this report is thorough and in-depth, because of 
                          space limitations, we could not include every aspect 
                          of what is known about the many ways in which sport 
                          and physical activity influence girls. We also addressed 
                          many issues related to diversity such as cultural or 
                          racial heritage and different physical abilities. However, 
                          what is clear from the authors&#146; findings is that 
                          we have a great deal more to learn about the particular 
                          ways in which involvement in sport and physical activity 
                          affects minority groups of girls. We urge others to 
                          use this document as a way to pursue future areas of 
                          research; many potential directions are outlined in 
                          detail in the authors&#146; research sections. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> It is important that the information 
                          presented in this document reaches a variety of audiences

                          importance of sport and physical activity for all girls. 
                          These hard-working individuals spend their days on the 
                          ball fields and playgrounds teaching skills and developing 
                          a young girl&#146;s character. They are on the phone 
                          at night organizing the next game, event or season. 
                          Their weekends are often spent at meetings and conferences. 
                          They fight for Title IX compliance, coverage of a game 
                          or a walkathon in the local paper, new uniforms, adequate 
                          facilities and safe fields.

                          encourage and motivate the development of physical activity, 
                          fitness and sport participation for all Americans. This 
                          report expresses the PCPFS&#146;s mission to inform 
                          the general public of the importance of developing and 
                          maintaining physical activity and fitness in our daily 
                          lives, and to heighten awareness of the links that exist 
                          between regular physical activity and good health. In 
                          the past, involvement in sport and physical activity 
                          has been primarily associated with males. Over the past 
                          two decades, however, girls&#146; and women&#146;s involvement 
                          in such activity has increased dramatically. This is 
                          in large part due to the impact of Title IX, federal 
                          legislation passed in 1972 designed to prohibit sex 
                          discrimination in educational settings. For example, 
                          prior to Title IX, 300,000 young women participated 
                          in interscholastic athletics nationwide; today, that 
                          figure has leaped to approximately 2.25 million participants. 
                          In the wake of this participation explosion, scholars 
                          and educators have begun to explore its impact on girls 
                          and women.

                          order to highlight relevant research and draw on expert

                          activity and sport. This is the first report that brings 
                          together research findings&#151;and practical suggestions 
                          for implementing these findings&#151;from three interdisciplinary 
                          bodies of knowledge: physiological, psychological and 
                          sociological. An additional section explores the relationships 
                          among physical activity, sport and the mental health 
                          of girls. The primary goal was to identify and discuss 
                          the beneficial ways that physical activity and sport 
                          influence girls&#146; physical health, psychological 
                          well-being and overall social and educational development. 
                          An additional goal was to identify the problematic aspects 
                          of girls&#146; involvement. These include, but are not 
                          limited to, eating disorders, gender stereotyping and 
                          institutional barriers such as lack of opportunity and 
                          access to various resources. Although this report examines 
                          some of the most current and cutting-edge issues, because 
                          of space limitations, the authors do not claim to include 
                          all relevant research and concerns surrounding girls&#146; 
                          involvement with sport and physical activity. </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The report focuses on girls and not 
                          boys (other than for comparison where appropriate) for 
                          several reasons. First, with respect to sport and physical 
                          activity, girls have been neglected by researchers in 
                          the biomedical sciences, education, physical education 
                          and the social sciences. Second, though girls and boys 
                          share common experiences, girls also exhibit unique 
                          physiological, emotional and social outcomes that merit 
                          special investigation. Next, scholars need to keep pace 
                          with the aforementioned explosion and diversification 
                          of girls&#146; involvement with sport and physical activity 
                          in the wake of Title IX. And finally, researchers increasingly 
                          recognize that the social world of physical activity 
                          and sport is not a one-dimensional universe, but a highly 
                          complex set of institutions populated by two genders 
                          with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, cultural 
                          values, physical abilities and sexual orientations. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Public apathy about physical education, 
                          and the glitzy distractions of commercialized sports 
                          in mass media, sometimes hide the basic fact that physical 
                          activity is a public health resource for millions of 
                          American girls as well as their families and communities. 
                          In order to advance knowledge regarding the real and 
                          potential contributions of physical activity and sport 
                          in the lives of millions of girls, several areas for 
                          future research are highlighted by the authors at the 
                          end of each section. Finally, a set of policy recommendations 
                          is also included in order to encourage responsible action 
                          on the part of parents, coaches, educators, sport leaders 
                          and elected officials. With such a &#147;teamwork&#148; 
                          approach, we can make a difference in the lives of girls.

                        <p class="graycopy"> WHEN THE PRESIDENT&#146;S COUNCIL 
                          ON PHYSICAL FITNESS AND SPORTS was established by Executive 
                          Order in 1956, few Americans could have imagined the 
                          surge of participation in physical activity and sport 
                          among girls and women over the last two decades. Millions 
                          of girls now participate in a rapidly expanding variety 
                          of physical activities, and female athletes perform 
                          feats that once were deemed physiologically impossible. 
                          Despite the startling speed of these recent changes, 
                          however, the explosion of women&#146;s participation 
                          and ability is more accurately viewed as an acceleration 
                          of a centuries-long march toward greater physical freedom 
                          and athletic excellence. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> During the nineteenth century, health 
                          reformers and educators included &#147;female gymnastics,&#148; 
                          walking, riding and dancing as key components of young 
                          women&#146;s education (Vertinsky, 1994). In the countryside 
                          and towns, archery, tennis, bicycling, ice boating, 
                          roller skating, croquet, golf and dance became popular 
                          among girls and women. A &#147;new model of able-bodied 
                          womanhood&#148; emerged, which challenged traditional 
                          notions about female frailty and ladylike behavior (Verbrugge, 
                          1988, p. 196). The integration of exercise and athletic 
                          activity into school curricula expanded during the twentieth 
                          century. Recreational athletics for girls became popular 
                          in the form of &#147;play days&#148; between 1920 and 
                          1950 and competitive varsity sports such as basketball 
                          and track and field multiplied after World War II (Hult, 
                          1994). The passage of Title IX in 1972 ushered in an 
                          era of coed physical education and greater opportunities 
                          for girls to play high school and college sports. The 
                          fitness revolution also grabbed the attention and allegiance 
                          of millions of girls and women during the 1970s and 
                          1980s.

                          portrayal of the connections among the physical, psychological, 
                          social and cultural aspects of physical activity and 
                          sport in girls&#146; lives. When viewed collectively, 
                          the research findings discussed here show how physical 
                          activity and sport impact the &#147;complete girl&#148;: 
                          that is, the many interrelated aspects of a girl&#146;s 
                          life ranging from musculoskeletal and cardiovascular 
                          functioning, to psychological well-being, gender identity, 
                          relationships with friends and family and performance 
                          in school. Physical activity and sport offer girls more 
                          than gateways to fun, competition or an elevated heart 
                          rate. While the authors of this report are aware that 
                          girls&#146; experiences vary a great deal, the vision 
                          of the complete girl fosters a comprehensive awareness 
                          that exercise and sport are not just about physical 
                          movement but personal development, identity and values 
                          as well. </span>

                        <p class="graycopy"> American girls now participate in 
                          a wider range of physical activities and sports, and 
                          at more levels of competition, than ever before in our 
                          history. While Oregon girls learn to square their shoulders 
                          to the volleyball net, a group of girls play &#147;four 
                          squares&#148; in rural New Hampshire, an Arkansas teenager 
                          teaches hopscotch to her little sister, and Native American 
                          teenagers meet for lacrosse practice. As girls bounce 
                          and chatter through double-dutch jump rope in Bedford-Stuyvesant, 
                          in-line skaters glide through a Houston suburb. As an 
                          Ohio high school basketball team runs through drills, 
                          friends from DeKalb, Illinois, meet for an aerobics 
                          class. And women give gutsy performances while winning 
                          gold medals at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in sports 
                          ranging from softball, soccer and basketball to gymnastics, 
                          track and field and swimming. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Females have become prime movers 
                          in the fitness realm. A recent nationwide survey conducted 
                          by the National Sporting Goods Association indicated 
                          that more women (55.4 million) than men (43.4 million) 
                          participate in several leading fitness activities&#151;aerobic 
                          exercising, bicycling, exercising with equipment, exercise 
                          walking, running and swimming. A more specific breakdown 
                          reveals that an estimated 18.3 million women do aerobics, 
                          26.5 million bike for exercise or mountain bike, 23.8 
                          million exercise with weights, 45.2 million walk, 8.65 
                          million run or jog and 32.6 million swim (National Sporting 
                          Goods Association, 1995). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Girls&#146; participation in school 
                          athletic programs and community-based programs is also 
                          mushrooming. Girls now comprise about 37 percent of 
                          all high-school athletes, representing an increase from 
                          one in 27 girls who participated in 1971 to one in three 
                          girls in 1994. The ratio for boys during this timeframe 
                          remained constant at one in two. In 1994&#150;1995, 
                          2,240,000 girls participated in high-school sports, 
                          compared to 3,554,429 boys, 37 percent and 63 percent 
                          respectively (National Federation of State High Schools 
                          Associations, 1995&#150;1996). In terms of some specific 
                          sports, an estimated eight million girls under age 17 
                          played basketball in 1994 (compared to 12.5 million 
                          boys) while 6.7 million girls played soccer. As more 
                          girls developed athletic interests and physical skills 
                          at the grassroots levels of competition during the 1970s 
                          and 1980s, participation in college and Olympic sports 
                          also exploded. Women now comprise 33 percent of all 
                          college athletes and approximately 39 percent of United 
                          States Olympic team members. Reciprocally, as more female 
                          role models become available for young girls to emulate, 
                          their interest and involvement in fitness and athletic 
                          activities will continue to grow. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Despite these gains, it is important 
                          to realize that women&#146;s historical trek toward 
                          greater physical and athletic opportunity has been filled 
                          with barriers. In the past, various individuals have 
                          condemned exercise and sport as unladylike and eminent 
                          physicians warned women against overstrain and sterility. 
                          One of the authors of this report, sport sociologist 
                          Margaret Duncan, points out that stereotypes associated 
                          with traditional notions of femininity and masculinity 
                          exalted boys&#146; strength and athletic feats while 
                          equating girls&#146; athletic talents with &#147;tomboyism.&#148; 
                          Parents, coaches and teachers often encouraged boys 
                          to test their physical and emotional limits while ignoring 
                          or coddling girls. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Today, girls&#146; achievements in 
                          physical activity and sport remain overshadowed by the 
                          cultural prominence of men&#146;s sports. In school 
                          and community-based programs, boys still receive a disproportionate 
                          share of opportunities to participate in exercise and 
                          sport. Male-dominated sports organizations remain mired 
                          in policies and beliefs that shortchange girls and women, 
                          and parents or advocates of girls are forced to wage 
                          expensive legal battles in the pursuit of gender equity. 
                          Indeed, it is unlikely that the large increase in girls&#146; 
                          athletic participation and growing cultural acceptance 
                          of physically active and athletic females would have 
                          occurred without the passage of Title IX (Birrell &#38; 
                          Cole, 1994; Cahn, 1994a; Messner &#38; Sabo, 1990). 
                          Pressured by the perceived threat of lawsuits or payment 
                          of legal fees, and pulled by increasing demands for 
                          greater opportunity for girls, Parent Teacher Associations 
                          and school administrators began to rethink traditional 
                          clich&#233;s like &#147;girls just aren&#146;t as physical 
                          as boys&#148; or &#147;sports are more important for 
                          boys than for girls.&#148; 
                        <p class="graycopy"> And finally, harsh economic conditions, 
                          prejudice and institutional barriers have limited the 
                          participation of many poor girls, girls of color and 
                          girls with disabilities. Ironically, where the real 
                          and potential health outcomes of physical activity and 
                          sport are probably most needed, participation rates 
                          and access to resources are most lacking. As the authors 
                          of this report repeatedly document, girls&#146; increasing 
                          participation and interest in physical activity and 
                          sport bode well for their health. Yet these positive 
                          national trends are being undermined by the growing 
                          numbers of adolescents who are becoming sedentary and 
                          obese, the substantial numbers of girls who are dropping 
                          out of sports, and the persistence of social and economic 
                          barriers that limit girls&#146; opportunities to develop 
                          physically active lifestyles.

                        <p class="graycopy"> Physical activity and sport are not 
                          simply things young girls do in addition to the rest 
                          of their lives, but rather, they comprise an interdependent 
                          set of physiological, psychological and social processes 
                          that can influence, and, in varying degrees, sustain 
                          girls&#146; growth and development. The interdisciplinary 
                          approach that underpins this report is designed to make 
                          more visible some of the connections among physical 
                          activity, sport and the rest of girls&#146; lives. Some 
                          examples of the broader linkages that are examined in 
                          the body of this report are highlighted below.

                        <p class="graycopy"> Within the traditional framework 
                          of psychoanalytic theory, nonconformity to traditional 
                          gender expectations was considered pathological. Hence, 
                          women&#146;s interest and involvement in business, science, 
                          sport or other &#147;masculine&#148; activities were 
                          clinically suspect. In contrast, the review of psychological 
                          research presented in this report shows that physical 
                          activity and sport are apt to strengthen rather than 
                          worsen the psychological health of girls. The authors 
                          document a combination of psychosocial benefits such 
                          as self-confidence, self-esteem, higher energy levels 
                          and positive body image. It is important to note that 
                          these gains appear to be influenced by interactions 
                          with parents, who can either encourage or dampen a daughter&#146;s 
                          interest and involvement. So, too, do persistent and 
                          narrow cultural prescriptions for appropriately &#147;feminine&#148; 
                          behavior erode the potential of physical activity and 
                          sport to enhance girls&#146; mental health. On the other 
                          end of the interdisciplinary spectrum, some of the biological 
                          and chemical processes associated with health and fitness 
                          concerns are also highlighted. And finally, two of the 
                          authors of this report, psychology of sport scholars 
                          Doreen Greenberg and Carole Oglesby, discuss the growing 
                          recognition among mental health professionals that exercise 
                          and sport can be effective treatment interventions for

                          in the United States; subsequently, the Surgeon General&#146;s 
                          report on physical activity and health (United States 
                          Department of Health and Human Services, 1996) identified 
                          physical inactivity as a serious public health problem 
                          nationwide. Aware of this concern, the authors of this 
                          report discuss a variety of factors associated with 
                          the rising rate of obesity among American adolescents. 
                          Social factors include the influence of television, 
                          dwindling requirements for physical education in the 
                          schools, and the steep sport dropout rate among adolescents. 
                          Related to physical health concerns, this report explores 
                          the physiological and epidemiological aspects of obesity 
                          such as the links between the development of hyperlipidemia, 
                          hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and diabetes, which 
                          in turn elevate risk for coronary heart disease. Finally, 
                          in her section on the psychological dimensions of participation, 
                          psychology of sport scholar Diane Wiese-Bjornstal stresses 
                          the need to help overweight or obese girls overcome 
                          social pressures and personal misgivings about physical 
                          activity so that they can become less sedentary.

                          </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Several authors discuss the complex 
                          combination of psychological and physiological processes 
                          that operate in relation to the female athlete triad. 
                          In Section I, exercise physiologist Patty Freedson and 
                          psychology of sport scholar Linda Bunker document many 
                          physiological benefits of exercise and sport participation 
                          for girls such as potential gains in strength and aerobic 
                          power. It also appears promising that girls&#146; involvement 
                          in sport and exercise could effect increased immune 
                          functioning and the prevention of certain cancers in 
                          adult life. They also express their concerns about the 
                          &#147;female athlete triad,&#148; which refers to three 
                          interrelated health problems that are prevalent among 
                          some types of female athletes and some girls who engage 
                          in excessive exercise: eating disorders, exercise-induced 
                          amenorrhea and bone loss. Several authors demonstrate 
                          how these syndromes have complex psychological, physiological 
                          and social origins and profiles. For example, girls&#146; 
                          perceptions of their bodies are partly shaped by unrealistic 
                          media images that create false connections between a 
                          lean body type or &#147;washboard abs&#148; and subsequent 
                          success, sex appeal and self-mastery. The obsession 
                          with thinness can also be fed by a coach who demands 
                          weight loss from the athlete, or the desire to be attractive 
                          to boys and accepted by one&#146;s peers. Because we 
                          are in the early stages of investigating this syndrome, 
                          the data we have are very limited. Female athletes most 
                          at risk should certainly be aware of the dangers, but 
                          we should not assume that the triad is limited to an 
                          athletic population (Lutter &#38; Jaffee, 1996).

                          the last ones to discover the ocean.&#148; In Section 
                          III, Margaret Duncan illustrates how several research 
                          findings debunk the &#147;dumb jock&#148; stereotype 
                          that high school athletes perform poorly in the classroom. 
                          School administrators are often unaware of the positive 
                          interplay between high-school athletics and academic 
                          achievement as measured by grade point average, standardized 
                          achievement test scores, lowered risk for dropout and 
                          greater likelihood to attend college. On average, female 
                          athletes fare better academically than female nonathletes, 
                          though Caucasian and Hispanic female athletes are more 
                          apt to derive some direct educational gains than are 
                          their African- American counterparts (&#147;Women&#146;s

                          1989). Good physical and mental health are also correlates 
                          of academic performance and social adjustment. Hence, 
                          from an interdisciplinary perspective, it is likely 
                          that athletic participation is part of a mutually reinforcing 
                          array of physical, psychological and social processes 
                          that enhance the overall educational experiences and 
                          commitments of many girls.

                        <p class="graycopy"> Girls from economically disadvantaged 
                          backgrounds, girls of color and girls with disabilities 
                          can face unique obstacles in relation to physical activity 
                          and sport. Poor families cannot afford to invest in 
                          health club memberships, exercise machines and equipment 
                          for their daughters. Families of color, who are disproportionately 
                          poor, often cannot pay user fees or transportation costs 
                          to bring daughters back and forth between home and school. 
                          Fitness and sport are often seen as unattainable luxuries 
                          rather than potential resources. Dual-worker parents 
                          or single parents (most often mothers) sometimes depend 
                          on older daughters to cook or care for smaller children 
                          after school, thus curbing their involvement with extracurricular 
                          activities. Poor or working-class girls often work part-time 
                          jobs to help families make ends meet, thereby reducing 
                          the amount of time and energy available for exercise 
                          or sports. Parental perceptions of the benefits of exercise 
                          and athletic participation for daughters also vary by 
                          race and class. For example, one national survey found 
                          that Caucasian parents more often mentioned health- 
                          related benefits, character benefits and social factors 
                          than did African-American parents (&#147;The Wilson 
                          Report: Moms, Dads, Daughters and Sports,&#148; 1988). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Many of the problems girls of color 
                          experience in relation to physical activity and sport 
                          grow out of the same soil&#151;poverty. Epidemiological 
                          research shows that exposure to violence, family fragmentation, 
                          substance abuse, sexually transmitted diseases and greater 
                          risk for unwanted sexual activity often share the common 
                          causality of poverty. Lack of physical activity and 
                          athletic opportunity can be added to this list. Economically 
                          disadvantaged girls of color are more likely to suffer 
                          from an unsafe and unhealthy environment. The simple 
                          act of walking or jogging may be problematic in neighborhoods 
                          where crime flourishes. Poor girls often do not have 
                          access to athletic resources, effective coaching and 
                          expert training. There is a lack of basic information 
                          about exercise, diet and sport. They are less apt to 
                          receive quality physical education and athletic training 
                          at earlier ages which, in turn, erodes the foundation 
                          for subsequent motor development. Because school and 
                          community athletic programs depend on tax dollars to 
                          thrive, capital flight from many urban areas is undermining 
                          the provision of adequate exercise and athletic opportunities 
                          for both minority girls and boys. The rising cost of 
                          liability insurance is also making it difficult for 
                          school districts, especially poorer ones, to provide 
                          quality athletic and intramural programs.

                          interests and physical activities of girls of color. 
                          Although women of color are often more visible in sport 
                          media, and in certain sports like basketball and track 
                          and field, they are underrepresented in sports such 
                          as swimming and tennis (Abney &#38; Richey, 1992). During 
                          the early 1980s, African-American and Hispanic adolescent 
                          females comprised about 4.4 percent and 3.2 percent 
                          of high school athletes respectively, compared to 29.1 
                          percent of their Caucasian counterparts (Melnick, Sabo, 
                          &#38; Vanfossen, 1992). There is also indirect evidence 
                          that African-American and other ethnic minority females 
                          are less physically active than Caucasian females (King 
                          et al., 1992; Pate et al., 1995). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> And finally, despite the accomplishments 
                          of the Special Olympics and Paralympics, few opportunities 
                          exist for emotionally or physically challenged adolescents 
                          to engage in exercise and sport. Differently-abled children 
                          are three times more likely to be sedentary than their 
                          able-bodied peers and the physical activity levels of 
                          children with disabilities drop precipitously during 
                          adolescence (Longmuir &#38; Bar-Or, 1994). It should 
                          be noted that the authors of this report make only periodic 
                          references to socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity 
                          and physical disability. This is due not so much to 
                          choice, however, as to the fact that so little research 
                          has focused on these groups of girls.

                          with physical activity and sport. However, because of 
                          the lack of available data and analysis, the authors 
                          of this report were unable to address in any depth some

                          activity and sport. Three emerging research concerns 
                          are briefly discussed below.

                        <p class="graycopy"> Adolescent pregnancy is a major social 
                          problem in the United States. Though the belief that 
                          sports can help many young girls avoid unwanted sexual 
                          behavior and pregnancy is widespread among coaches and 
                          athletes, precious little research has been done in 
                          this area (Sabo &#38; Melnick, 1996). Two recent studies 
                          shed some initial empirical light on the hypothesized 
                          connections among exercise, athletics and adolescent 
                          girls&#146; sexual behavior. First, Brown, Ellis, Guerrina, 
                          Paxton and Poleno (1996) analyzed female adolescents&#146; 
                          responses to the United States Department of Health 
                          and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for 
                          Disease Control and Prevention (1995) survey, &#147;Health 
                          Risk Behavior for the Nation&#146;s Youth.&#148; The 
                          researchers found that the more days adolescent females 
                          exercised per week, the more likely they were to postpone 
                          their first experience with sexual intercourse. Second, 
                          preliminary analysis from a study of adolescents from 
                          western New York (an area with one of the highest rates 
                          of adolescent pregnancy in the United States) indicated 
                          that higher rates of athletic participation among adolescent 
                          females were significantly associated with lower rates 
                          of both sexual activity and pregnancy (Sabo, Farrell, 
                          Melnick, &#38; Barnes, 1996).

                        <p class="graycopy"> Sexual harassment is experienced 
                          by approximately 31 percent of female high school students 
                          (American Association of University Women Educational 
                          Foundation [AAUW], 1993). Sport scholars have recently 
                          begun to study the prevalence and social-psychological 
                          dynamics of sexual harassment in athletic settings (Sabo 
                          &#38; Oglesby, 1995). Many key questions need to be 
                          addressed. For example, how do female athletes perceive 
                          and react to sexual harassment from boys and adults? 
                          Do higher self-esteem and physical prowess fostered 
                          by sports help females to be more assertive with inappropriately 
                          invasive males than their non-athletic counterparts? 
                          Additional research needs to be done on the ways that 
                          athletic participation may empower girls to more effectively 
                          cope with sexually hostile situations.

                        <p class="graycopy"> Regretfully, little research has 
                          focused on the ways that exercise and sport promote 
                          interaction and insight between parents and children. 
                          As is the case with sexual harassment, many important 
                          questions in this area remain unanswered. Do parents 
                          look to sport to provide after-school activities that 
                          keep daughters physically active, socially engaged and 
                          off the streets? To what extent do physical activity 
                          and sport help parents nurture moral development and 
                          values in their children? In what ways can parents effectively 
                          encourage their daughters&#146; involvement with physical 
                          activity and sport? Clearly, more investigation of the 
                          interdependencies among physical activity, sport, families 
                          and schools is needed.

                        <p class="graycopy"> This report will fuel the growing 
                          awareness that physical activity and sport are enormously 
                          important in the lives of girls. Perhaps this message 
                          is being sent by girls themselves who are, as the saying 
                          goes, &#147;voting with their feet,&#148; and entering 
                          the realms of fitness and sport in vastly increasing 
                          numbers. In contrast to the nineteenth century naysayers 
                          who decried strenuous exercise and athletic participation 
                          for women as dangerous and unladylike, today, educators 
                          and public health advocates recognize the overall benefits 
                          for girls&#146; physical health and emotional well-being. 
                          As health care costs continue to escalate, and pressures 
                          on the American health care system to provide quality 
                          care intensify, the logic of preventive health strategies 
                          that involve physical activity and sport becomes economically 
                          salient. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The overall vision that emerges from 
                          this report frames physical activity as a developmental 
                          aid and public health asset for girls and, by inference, 
                          for boys as well. Physical activity can serve as a social 
                          and cultural intersection where adolescents, parents 
                          and caring adults can come together in mutually supportive 
                          ways. The aerobics class, fitness run or basketball 
                          court are safety zones where young girls can hang out 
                          together, test and challenge themselves, learn about 
                          competition, develop physical fitness components such 
                          as cardiovascular endurance, strength and flexibility, 
                          and have fun all at the same time. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The real and potential benefits that 
                          physical activity and sport have to offer girls, their 
                          families and communities, however, continue to be stymied 
                          by several factors. Economic and cultural barriers block 
                          wider participation, especially for poor girls and girls 
                          of color. Despite increasing interest and participation 
                          rates, physical activity and sport remain underutilized 
                          resources for the many girls who are mired by sedentary 
                          lifestyles or dissuaded from getting involved because 
                          of gender stereotypes, discriminatory practices and 
                          lack of opportunity. There are also appreciable numbers 
                          of girls for whom athletic participation is associated 
                          with illness, injury and addiction to exercise rather 
                          than with physical and mental well-being. And finally, 
                          there needs to be more systematic research on the numerous 
                          ways that physical activity and sport influence girls&#146; 
                          lives. Simply put, too little research has been done 
                          in an area where girls have too much to gain. For this 
                          reason, each of the authors has listed priorities for 
                          future research at the end of their respective sections. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> This report concludes with a list 
                          of policy recommendations. The information and analyses 
                          gathered here hold implications for parents, educators, 
                          coaches, athletic administrators, public health officials 
                          and lawmakers. There is more at stake in the struggle 
                          to expand girls&#146; physical abilities and athletic 
                          opportunities than learning to do jumping jacks or winning 
                          and losing games. Future policy decisions need to be 
                          grounded in the broader understanding that girls&#146; 
                          involvement with physical activity and sport is just 
                          as much about physical vitality, emotional well-being, 
                          community health and educational opportunity as it is 
                          about who runs the farthest or scores the most points.

                          EFFECTS OF EXERCISE and sport participation on adolescents 
                          and adults. However, the majority of this research was 
                          conducted on males, or focused on comparisons between 
                          boys and girls, with little research focusing exclusively 
                          on females. The present review must therefore include 
                          research on adults and males, as well as the biophysical 
                          effects of physical activity and sport on girls and 
                          the potential impact of these experiences on their maturation 
                          and adult lives. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The acquisition of fundamental motor 
                          proficiency, which is directly linked to physical activity, 
                          is an important goal for early childhood. Not only must 
                          children learn to control their bodies in space, they 
                          also need to acquire the fundamental skills which will 
                          aid daily living, vocational pursuits and recreational/leisure 
                          activities. These skills are interdependent with health-related 
                          physical fitness and must be considered in any discussion 
                          of the biophysical effects of physical activity on girls. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> It is important that activities in 
                          childhood include both the motor and health aspects 
                          of physical fitness. Both health-related fitness and 
                          motor skill development are important because: (a) children 
                          need a reasonable level of motor skill proficiency to 
                          participate in activities that build endurance, power 
                          and strength, and (b) they need reasonable levels of 
                          fitness to engage in exercise and sport activities which 
                          will provide them with physical activity as adults. 
                          Recognizing the need for both motor skill development 
                          and adequate fitness is critical because the benefit 
                          of lifetime participation in physical activity has an 
                          impact on psychological aspects (see also Section II: 
                          Psychological Dimensions), social aspects (see also 
                          Section III: Sociological Dimensions) and the mental 
                          health of young girls and women (see also Section IV: 
                          Mental Health Dimensions). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The simultaneous acquisition of both 
                          motor and physical fitness begins in early childhood, 
                          as children use movement as their mechanism to learn 
                          about their world. It continues in school where all 
                          children should participate in daily physical education 
                          activities which set both the pattern of physical activity 
                          and the fundamental skills to be successful and happy 
                          when participating. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Physical activity has long been recognized 
                          for its effects on the maturing child. However, one 
                          of the challenges of interpreting research on children 
                          is the difficulty of differentiating between the changes 
                          in physiological functioning which may be affected by 
                          regular exercise or strenuous training, and those effects 
                          which are the natural result of maturation. This problem 
                          is compounded by the traditional use of control groups 
                          to help differentiate between the effects of the exercise 
                          intervention and those of normal growth and development, 
                          because most children are already quite active (Bar-Or, 
                          1989). This makes the experimental designs more complicated, 
                          the exercise interventions more intensive than those 
                          which would be adequate for adult participants, and 
                          the interpretation of the data more challenging for 
                          the researcher. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The biophysical changes which result 
                          from exercise and training may shift in the same direction 
                          as those which occur due to maturation, or they may 
                          change in the opposite direction. For example, peak 
                          anaerobic power <i>increases</i> due to both maturation 
                          and physical training. Similarly, <i>decreases</i> in 
                          oxygen cost of moving are also caused by both maturation 
                          and physical training. With respect to biophysical changes 
                          in the opposite direction, the body&#146;s ability to 
                          use oxygen (i.e., anaerobic threshold, percent V. O<sub>2</sub> 
                          max) <i>decreases</i> due to maturation but <i>increases</i> 
                          as a result of training (Bar-Or &#38; Malina, 1995). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> It is possible to consider the known 
                          effects of physical activity in many different ways. 
                          The following information clusters the research into 
                          three categories related to biophysical considerations: 
                          benefits for girls, potential deleterious effects and 
                          potential long-term effects related to disease prevention 
                          and quality of life.

                        <p class="graycopy"> Research on the biophysical impact 
                          of exercise on children and adolescents is quite extensive 
                          although, as previously mentioned, investigations focusing 
                          exclusively on girls is limited. The following information 
                          addresses those benefits specifically relevant to girls. 
                          We focus in particular on benefits related to power 
                          (i.e., aerobic power or endurance and anaerobic power), 
                          strength, weight management and health-related issues 
                          such as immune function effects and reproductive maturation. 
                        <p> <span class="graycopy"><b><i>Strength </i></b> </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Muscular strength is defined as the 
                          ability to generate force and includes dynamic or isotonic 
                          strength (i.e., the ability to generate force through 
                          a range of motion) and isometric strength (i.e., the 
                          ability to generate force at a single point in the range 
                          of motion where muscle length does not change). With 
                          respect to the maturing female, girls grow stronger 
                          as they mature, making it difficult to assess whether 
                          changes are the result of maturation or physical activity 
                          levels. However, several studies have found that short-term 
                          training programs can produce increases in muscle strength 
                          in children (Grodjinovsky &#38; Bar- Or, 1984; Sale, 
                          1989). Pfeiffer and Francis (1986) have suggested that 
                          the relative gain in strength due to exercise is similar 
                          for all children, whether they be prepubescent, pubescent 
                          or postpubescent. According to Malina and Beunen (1996), 
                          &#147;prepubescent&#148; is defined as the absence of 
                          development of secondary sex characteristics, &#147;pubescent&#148; 
                          is initial and continued development of secondary sex 
                          characteristics, and &#147;postpubescent&#148; is adult 
                          or mature state of development for secondary sex characteristics. 
                          Increases in physical activity and short-term training 
                          programs can produce positive changes in several forms 
                          of &#147;strength-related&#148; factors, including anaerobic 
                          power and muscle endurance. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Maturation-related strength increases 
                          at a linear rate for most girls up until about age 14. 
                          Beyond that point, the rate of increase slows and for 
                          sedentary girls may actually decrease (Blimkie, 1989;

                          physical activity can produce marked improvement in 
                          strength for girls, probably due to the improvement 
                          in motor unit activation and coordination (Sewall &#38;

                        <p class="graycopy"> The concept of power is related to 
                          the capacity to do work per unit time and is directly 
                          related to both muscular strength and cardiovascular 
                          functioning. The following discussion of power includes 
                          both aerobic power which is necessary for endurance 
                          activities and anaerobic power which is necessary for

                        <p class="graycopy"> Cardiorespiratory fitness represents 
                          the maximal transport of oxygen, which is a function 
                          of the product of heart-rate and stroke volume (i.e., 
                          cardiac output), the oxygen-carrying capacity of the 
                          blood (i.e., hemoglobin content) and the maximal arterio-venous 
                          oxygen difference. Aerobic power is typically measured 
                          by V. O<sub>2</sub> max as determined by either cycle 
                          ergometry or treadmill exercise. Expressed as an absolute

                          measurements of aerobic power are extremely reliable 
                          in both children and adults if standard criteria defining 
                          maximal responses are used and if subjects&#151;children 
                          and adults&#151;participate with maximum effort.

                          girls suggests that it increases with growth prior to 
                          adolescence, but in the absence of systematic exercise, 
                          it steadily declines into adulthood. Summarizing cross-sectional 
                          data from several studies testing children of different 
                          ages, Armstrong and Weisman (1994) reported a decrease 
                          in absolute aerobic power in adolescent girls 13 to 
                          15 years of age. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Despite the apparent decrease in 
                          absolute aerobic power in females ages 13 to 15, the 
                          overall rate of increase in treadmill absolute aerobic 
                          power for females between the ages of eight and 16 was 
                          approximately 12l &#149; yr<sup>-1</sup>. Examination 
                          of treadmill-relative aerobic power across age revealed 
                          a steady decline for females (Armstrong &#38; Weisman, 
                          1994). Aerobic power relative to body mass (i.e., V. 
                          O<sub>2</sub> max expressed as ml &#149; kg<sup>-1</sup> 
                          &#149; min<sup>-1</sup>) averaged 50ml &#149; kg<sup>-1</sup> 
                          &#149; min-1 for girls at eight years of age which decreased 
                          to approximately 40ml &#149; kg<sup>-1</sup> &#149; 
                          min<sup>-1</sup> by age 16. This trend was not observed 
                          for males across the same age span; they maintained 
                          a relatively stable aerobic power of approximately 55ml 
                          &#149; kg-1 &#149; min<sup>-1</sup> (Armstrong &#38; 
                          Weisman, 1994). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> This decrease in aerobic power is 
                          most apparent at the time of puberty when there is an 
                          increase in body fat. Additionally, cross-sectional 
                          data indicate that inactive children have lower V.O2 
                          max than normally or highly active children (Malina 
                          &#38; Bouchard, 1991). Fortunately, this decline in 
                          aerobic power can be reversed with aerobic training 
                          (Rowland, 1989). Both short-term and long-term training 
                          programs seem to result in about the same improvements 
                          in maximal aerobic power among sedentary older children 
                          and adults (Bar-Or &#38; Malina, 1995; Pate &#38; Ward, 
                          1990). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Aerobic power and endurance performance 
                          are closely related in adults, but seem to be dissociated 
                          in adolescents. Specific to adolescent females, aerobic 
                          power expressed relative to body mass declines through 
                          normal growth and development, yet endurance performance 
                          (e.g., timed mile run) improves. For example, time to 
                          complete a one-mile run improves by approximately 15 
                          percent in females between eight and 17 years of age, 
                          despite a 20 percent decrease in relative aerobic power 
                          (Rowland, 1989). Nonetheless, it should be pointed out 
                          that regular exercise can increase oxygen uptake and 
                          diminish some of the decline that would otherwise occur. 
                          Improvements in running economy that occur with maturation 
                          most likely explain the dissociation between aerobic 
                          power and endurance performance in adolescence.

                        <p class="graycopy"> Anaerobic power, or the capacity

                          does not rely as extensively on the cardiovascular system. 
                          For most girls, anaerobic power (such as that required 
                          to do a vertical jump) increases throughout early childhood, 
                          but decreases in adolescence and young adulthood. However,

                          training for adolescents (10 to 13 years) range up to 
                          about 20 percent.

                          the most prevalent chronic illness among children in 
                          North America and represents an immense public health 
                          challenge&#148; (Bar-Or &#38; Malina, 1995, p. 110). 
                          A child is considered obese when his or her weight-height 
                          ratio is 20 percent or more above the upper limit of 
                          the desirable weight as assessed by primary care physicians 
                          and pediatricians using standard growth charts (Insel 
                          &#38; Roth, 1991). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> According to data from the National 
                          Center for Health Statistics (1991), approximately twice 
                          as many children are overweight today compared to children 
                          in the 1960s (Blair et al., 1996). It should be noted 
                          that juvenile obesity is particularly prevalent in girls 
                          from highly urbanized areas (Dietz &#38; Gortmaker, 
                          1984), some ethnic groups (e.g., Hispanic Americans, 
                          Pima Indians [King &#38; Tribble, 1990]) and those with 
                          disabilities (Dietz, 1995). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Problems with weight control occur 
                          when the caloric intake does not match the caloric expenditure. 
                          Though the major problem for obese individuals may be 
                          the nature of the calories consumed (especially excess 
                          fat intake in terms of the percent of the total calories), 
                          exercise is an important adjunct in weight control for 
                          high-school girls (Wells, 1991; Moody, Wilmore, Girandola, 
                          &#38; Royce, 1972) and for women 18 and over (Miller, 
                          Lindeman, Wallace, &#38; Niederpruem, 1990). Exercise 
                          has the effect of increasing caloric expenditure, and 
                          also seems to protect fat-free mass while promoting 
                          the loss of fat mass (King &#38; Tribble, 1990). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> For the general population of girls, 
                          their daily routine provides an adequate balance of 
                          physical activity and caloric intake. However, to assist 
                          the obese child, it is essential that a multidisciplinary 
                          program include nutrition education and increased physical 
                          activity both during weight loss and afterward. Many 
                          of these programs are provided in physical education 
                          programs within our schools and, as Ward and Bar-Or 
                          (1986) have suggested, this is the most practical way 
                          to combat this national problem. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Vogel (1986) presented an extensive 
                          review of physical education programs and concluded 
                          that daily programs can produce changes in body composition 
                          (i.e., percent lean versus fat mass), aerobic fitness, 
                          balance, endurance performance and lipoprotein profiles 
                          (especially for children with elevated lipoproteins). 
                          In addition, when programs are designed to promote motor 
                          skills and aerobic fitness, changes in skinfold thickness 
                          may occur (Simons-Morton, Parcel, &#38; O&#146;Hara, 
                          1988). The key to controlling obesity is a combination 
                          of caloric reduction and increasing caloric expenditure. 
                          However, when controlling obesity, one must keep in 
                          mind the concurrent need to support the growth process 
                          and to maintain nutritional adequacy.

                          and physical activity must be discussed in relation 
                          to the intensity of the activity (Liesen &#38; Uhlenbruck, 
                          1992). A great deal of research reports that low- to 
                          moderate-intensity training enhances immune function 
                          with increases in levels of interleukin-1 and interferon 
                          and increased numbers of natural killer cells, circulating 
                          lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes and phagocytic 
                          macrophages (Kramer &#38; Wells, 1996). However, with 
                          exhaustive or very intense and prolonged training, there 
                          may be a depression of immunological function. Overtraining 
                          may depress the levels of immunoglobulin in blood and 
                          saliva, reduce the responsiveness of T-lymphocytes to 
                          antibody synthesis and increase the risk of infectious 
                          and viral diseases (Newsholme &#38; Parry- Billings, 
                          1994). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The T-lymphocytes and natural killer 
                          cells seem to function as a tumor inhibitor to retard 
                          the growth of cells which have been genetically damaged 
                          (i.e., cancer). Similarly, monocyte and macrophage function 
                          also decreases the likelihood that aberrant cells will 
                          be facilitated or that metastases will occur. Thus it 
                          appears that moderate intensity exercise may have a 
                          positive effect in retarding diseases such as cancer 
                          or those caused by viruses such as colds or influenza 
                          (Newsholme &#38; Parry-Billings, l994). See the section 
                          below entitled &#147;Potential Long-Term Effects&#148; 
                          for a more detailed discussion of this topic. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Research on the effects of exercise 
                          on the immune system is mixed, depending on both age 
                          and intensity of physical activity. There is some evidence 
                          that increased physical activity produces moderate immune 
                          response suppression, but the clinical importance of 
                          this response is debatable (Calabrese, 1990). For example, 
                          adolescent athletes have been found to be more susceptible 
                          to infections than nonathletes (Shephard, 1984), but 
                          this may also be true for other children who participate 
                          in group activities in close proximity to one another 
                          (e.g., band, drama). In contrast, in a prospective study, 
                          Osterback and Ovarnberg (1987) found no difference in 
                          immune function between 12 year-old athletes and nonathletes.

                          report less physical distress associated with the cycle 
                          and increased periodicity (i.e., regularity) when moderate

                          that menarche occurred later in athletes than nonathletes. 
                          An alternative explanation was offered by Malina (1983) 
                          who suggested that young females who mature early are 
                          socialized away from sports participation. For the young 
                          female athlete, late maturation accompanied by delayed 
                          fat deposition favors athletic success and may result 
                          in a type of self-selection. In other words, delayed 
                          menarche may result in continued participation in competitive 
                          sport (Stager, Wigglesworth, &#38; Hatler, 1990). Wells 
                          (1991) summarized data from several studies and reported 
                          the age of menarche for girls participating at different 
                          competitive levels: nonathletes = 12.29 years, athletes 
                          = 13.02 years, college athletes = 13.05 years, national-level 
                          track and field athletes = 13.58 years, Olympic athletes 
                          (Montreal) = 13.66 years, national-level middle-distance 
                          runners = 14.10 years, Olympic volleyball athletes = 
                          14.18 years and national-level runners = 14.20 years. 
                          It should be noted that these data were collected retrospectively 
                          and may be influenced by recall bias in which athletes 
                          remember later menarche. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Delayed menarche is a particularly 
                          complex issue which could have both positive and negative 
                          consequences. Historically, delayed menarche, which 
                          is often found in female athletes who train at high 
                          levels, was viewed as a problem because it supposedly 
                          compromised fertility (Frisch, Wyshak, &#38; Vincent, 
                          1980). More recently, concern about delayed menarche 
                          has focused on its impact on peak bone density. Menarche 
                          is associated with an increase in circulating levels 
                          of estrogen. Estrogen is a necessary hormonal trigger 
                          for increasing bone density in adolescence and maintaining 
                          bone density in the mature female. Studies have reported 
                          that early menarche is associated with increased bone 
                          density (Fehily, Coles, Evans, &#38; Elwood, 1992; Johnell 
                          &#38; Nilsson, 1984). Research examining the relationship 
                          between delayed menarche in athletic females and bone 
                          density is lacking. Nevertheless, it is possible that 
                          delayed menarche and/or amenorrhea with their associated 
                          reduced circulating estrogen may result in reduced peak 
                          bone mass and increased risk of osteoporosis in later 
                          life because the available time for laying down bone 
                          is reduced (Wells, l991). This concern seems to be greatest 
                          for females who train at very high levels and who may 
                          experience both delayed menarche and amenorrhea. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> On the other hand, delayed menarche 
                          may be of some positive significance because the early 
                          onset of menarche has been linked with increased risk 
                          for breast cancer (Doll &#38; Peto, 1981). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Participation in regular exercise 
                          or sport may also reduce the likelihood of childhood 
                          obesity, which often produces earlier onset of menarche.

                        <p class="graycopy"> In general, moderate to strenuous 
                          physical activity poses few risks to the healthy girl 
                          and, when deleterious effects do occur, they seem to 
                          involve the musculoskeletal system. Benefits to cardiovascular 
                          functioning seem to be unanimously supported, with no 
                          known evidence to suggest detrimental effects (Nudel 
                          et al., 1989). There is, however, growing evidence to 
                          suggest that we should be concerned for girls who are 
                          training at the elite level, primarily because of overuse 
                          injuries and changes in reproductive system maturation 
                          and functioning. Three of these concerns&#151;osteoporosis, 
                          amenorrhea and disordered eating&#151;have sometimes 
                          been lumped together and described as the &#147;Female 
                          Athlete Triad.&#148; The foundation for these problems 
                          is that there is often a preoccupation with body weight 
                          and composition among female athletes. This may lead 
                          to undereating and overexercise and underconsumption 
                          of calories which together produce undesirable health-related 
                          consequences. It should be noted that this is not a 
                          problem unique to girls, but one which is also found 
                          in boys who participate in such activities as gymnastics, 
                          ice skating and wrestling (Hui, 1995). 
                        <p> <span class="graycopy"><i><b>Injuries</b></i> </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Increased levels of physical activity 
                          and sport participation are bound to produce increases 
                          in injuries. Many of these injuries are caused by inappropriate 
                          grouping of children based solely on age, without respect 
                          to maturation, weight or skill level. When children 
                          are grouped by chronological age, the smaller, less 
                          mature individual may be forced to compete against a 
                          more mature individual who is larger, stronger and faster. 
                          Similarly, increased participation in competitive sport 
                          for children may necessitate making a distinction between 
                          injuries caused by physical contact or purposeful intent 
                          (e.g., sliding into second base to break up a double 
                          play), versus those that occur as routine injuries (e.g., 
                          a sprained ankle). Differences in maturation and in 
                          the child&#146;s purpose of participation&#151;as well 
                          as intensity/seriousness of training and competition&#151;may 
                          present the potential for decreased performance and 
                          physical harm. All of these factors may discourage children 
                          from participating. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Injuries may also be caused by inappropriate 
                          levels of strength and flexibility needed for particular 
                          activities. Through appropriate educational programs 
                          generally provided in school physical education, children 
                          and coaches/teachers should learn appropriate techniques 
                          for proper warm-up, stretching and physical conditioning. 
                        <p> <span class="graycopy"><i><b>Amenorrhea</b></i> </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Some young women experience irregular 
                          or interrupted menstrual cycles which have been associated 
                          with excessive exercise. It is not clear whether this 
                          is a benefit (in relation to reduced estrogen- dependent 
                          cancers due to fewer ovulatory cycles) or a liability 
                          (in relation to such outcomes as lower bone density). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The etiology of amenorrhea (i.e., 
                          interrupted menstrual cycle) may not simply be a high 
                          level of energy expended in exercise, but may also be 
                          related to energy imbalance, which is a function of 
                          both energy intake and energy expenditure (Loucks &#38; 
                          Heath, 1994; Wakat, Sweeney, &#38; Rogol, 1982). This 
                          concept is supported by studies that have shown normal 
                          reproductive function even with increased exercise energy 
                          expenditure when caloric intake was not limited (Rogol 
                          et al., 1992). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Strenuous physical training may produce 
                          ovulatory dysfunction and shortened luteal phases of 
                          the menstrual cycle, perhaps combined with a prolonged 
                          follicular phase (Loucks, Vaitukaitis, &#38; Cameron, 
                          1992). One explanation for this is the activity of the 
                          hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis which may 
                          depress the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator (Kramer 
                          &#38; Wells, 1996).

                          linked to amenorrhea and osteoporosis. Female athletes 
                          who are amenorrheic or oligomenorrheic (i.e., irregular 
                          cycles) have been found to have lower bone densities 
                          than the general population (Drinkwater et al., 1984;

                        <p class="graycopy"> Much has been written about the problems 
                          of disordered eating in elite female athletes or those 
                          who train at extreme levels. The pressures to maintain 
                          the so-called &#147;ideal physique&#148; may produce 
                          dysfunctional eating habits and result in body fat levels 
                          which drop too low (Steen, 1991; Wilmore, 1974). The 
                          negative health consequences of anorexia and bulimia 
                          (i.e., bingeing on food then purging) are great and 
                          deserve attention, but it is important to realize that 
                          this is not a problem which is &#147;caused&#148; by 
                          exercise, but rather by psychological issues in the 
                          life of girls (see also Section II: Psychological Dimensions, 
                          on the psychological effects of exercise on girls). 
                          Female athletes who participate in sports where body 
                          weight and appearance are considered to be essential 
                          components for optimal performance (e.g., distance runners, 
                          figure skaters, gymnasts and dancers) are particularly 
                          vulnerable to this problem (Montgomery, 1991). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> A survey by Rosen and Hough (1988) 
                          indicated that one hundred percent of gymnasts studied 
                          were on a diet, 62 percent were using a method of weight 
                          control that was extreme, and 75 percent were told by 
                          their coaches that they had to lose weight. Similar 
                          observations have been reported in ballet dancers (Braisted, 
                          Mellin, Gong, &#38; Irwin, 1985). Although data are 
                          lacking, it seems reasonable to conclude that adolescent 
                          female athletes involved in sports where weight and 
                          body fat are predictors of successful performance, have 
                          an increased risk for developing disordered eating patterns. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In addition, it should be noted that 
                          the presence of disordered eating is not only seen in 
                          elite-level athletes but also among young girls who 
                          strive to be elite-level performers. Young athletes 
                          who are not particularly successful in sport may also 
                          be susceptible to this problem as they see dietary practices 
                          as something they can control and use to please their 
                          coach or parent despite the fact that high level performance 
                          is not possible.

                        There is growing evidence about the link between several 
                        prominent adult degenerative diseases and the lack of 
                        adequate physical activity and improper diet. This seems 
                        to suggest that there are potentially positive effects

                          General&#146;s Report on Physical Activity and Health 
                          (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1996) 
                          that, in the United States, coronary heart disease has 
                          a higher mortality rate than all types of cancer combined. 
                          The disease is thought to begin in childhood and results 
                          in atherosclerotic plaques lining the arteries of the 
                          heart and reducing blood flow and oxygen delivery to 
                          the heart. The primary pathology associated with coronary 
                          heart disease (CHD) is atherosclerosis, which is linked 
                          to elevated blood cholesterol levels and hypertension. 
                          There appears to be a direct link between CHD and elevated 
                          levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein 
                          cholesterol (LDL), very-low- density lipoprotein cholesterol 
                          (VLDL) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
                          (HDL) (National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP], 
                          1991).

                          levels of body fat reportedly have a greater risk for

                          (Williams et al., 1992). The link here is dramatic, 
                          because children who have high levels of cholesterol 
                          are almost three times more likely than other children 
                          to have high cholesterol levels as adults (NCEP, 1991).

                          best strategies for lowering cholesterol levels appear 
                          to be a combination of diet and exercise. These authors 
                          also discovered that exercise may be beneficial because 
                          it lowered blood pressure, perhaps through decreased 
                          cardiac output and decreased peripheral resistance, 
                          and exercise may also reduce the risk of thrombosis 
                          because of positive effects on blood clotting. It is 
                          important to note that this major review examined studies 
                          which sampled males and females across the lifespan.

                          is probably intimately related to diet and body composition. 
                          Obesity is associated with an increased risk for endometrial 
                          and gall-bladder cancers in women and the magnitude 
                          of excess weight is also related to breast cancer in 
                          postmenopausal women (Kimm &#38; Kwiterovich, 1995). 
                          Though little evidence exists that the physical activity 
                          of girls directly affects such cancers, it is likely 
                          that establishing a habit of regular exercise may continue 
                          into adulthood and aid in the maintenance of appropriate 
                          weight. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Few studies have been done that are 
                          prospective or that begin with younger women. One exception 
                          is a case-control study by Bernstein, Ross and Henderson 
                          (1992). These authors reported that with respect to 
                          cancer, a strong link exists between exercise and menstrual 
                          cycles. The authors also state that for every year that 
                          menarche is delayed, breast cancer is reduced five to 
                          15 percent. Finally, these authors found that women 
                          who start menstruating at an early age, and establish 
                          regular cycles quickly, have a higher risk of cancer 
                          than those with later menarche or irregular cycles. 
                          This is a particularly salient finding because later 
                          onset of menarche and/or irregular cycles are typical 
                          of girls who participate in high levels of training

                        Questions remain regarding the link between physical inactivity 
                        and increased incidence of estrogen-dependent cancers; 
                        further research is thus needed in this area. One of the 
                        difficulties in interpreting these data is the confounding 
                        variable of body mass. It is not absolutely clear if the 
                        beneficial effects result from the physical activity itself, 
                        or are the result of less body fat because of an active 
                        lifestyle. High body fat and obesity are related to low 
                        levels of sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which is 
                        the primary carrier for estradiol, an active form of endogenous 
                        estrogen. These low levels of SHBG may facilitate more 
                        free estradiol which may stimulate tumor growth (Bernstein 
                        &#38; Ross, 1993). Further research is needed in this 
                        important area of investigation. </span>

                          and reduced cancer may be the effect of serious training 
                          on menarche. Research has suggested that the risk of 
                          breast cancer is reduced up to 15 percent for each later 
                          year of age at menarche (Hsieh, Trichopoulos, Katsouyanni, 
                          &#38; Yuasa, 1990). Women whose natural menopause occurs 
                          before age 35 have been found to have a decreased incidence 
                          of breast cancer, while those with natural menopause 
                          after age 55 have an increased incidence. This may suggest 
                          an association between the cumulative number of ovulatory 
                          menstrual cycles and estrogen-dependent breast cancer 
                          (Kampert, Whitemore, &#38; Paffenbarger, 1988). If this 
                          is true, an increase in physical activity during adolescence 
                          may be an ideal nonhormonal approach to decrease the 
                          number of lifetime ovulatory cycles and reduce exposure 
                          to estrogen (Bernstein et al., 1992).

                          of diabetes are associated with the increased risk of 
                          heart disease and hypertension. Developing the habit

                        <p class="graycopy"> Noninsulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM), 
                          &#147;known as the insulin-resistance/ hyperinsulinemia 
                          syndrome&#148; (Blair et al., 1996, p. 336), often occurs

                          and atherosclerosis. Regular exercise is important in 
                          both the prevention and management of NIDDM by increasing 
                          glucose transporter concentration and disposal and by 
                          increasing insulin sensitivity and lowering plasma insulin 
                          concentrations (Horton, 1986). Women who participate 
                          in vigorous exercise at least once per week have shown 
                          a reduced risk of NIDDM (Manson et al., 1991), while 
                          children (both obese and lean) have better glucose control 
                          in response to regular exercise (Zierath &#38; Wallberg-Henriksson,

                          the aging process and the loss of estrogen levels after 
                          menopause often results in osteoporosis. The risk factors 
                          associated with osteoporosis include age, race, height-to-weight 
                          ratio and menopause in women. The three most important 
                          factors that contribute to healthy bones appear to be 
                          hormonal, nutritional and mechanical (Blair et al., 
                          1996). Because there is no cure for this condition once 
                          it occurs, efforts must focus on prevention. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In young childhood and adolescence, 
                          the development of peak bone mass is directly affected 
                          by regular physical activity combined with adequate 
                          calcium and vitamin D intake. Greater bone mass develops 
                          due to weight bearing, which is most often experienced 
                          during physical activity, and helps to protect against 
                          osteoporosis later in life when bone loss occurs. In 
                          fact, it is essential to place demands on bone for it 
                          to remain healthy. For example, a young adult at bed-rest 
                          for one week will lose about one percent of spinal density, 
                          which could take up to four months to regain (Krolner 
                          &#38; Toft, 1983). In contrast, it has been found that 
                          young tennis players have higher bone density in their 
                          preferred (racket holding arm) than in their other arm, 
                          thus supporting the positive role of placing demands 
                          on bone (Jacobson, Beaver, Grubb, Taft, &#38; Talmage, 
                          1984).

                          it is important for children, particularly adolescents, 
                          to participate in regular (preferably daily) physical 
                          activity (Kimm &#38; Kwiterovich, 1995). The growth 
                          and development of children should also be monitored 
                          in terms of optimal weight and the balance of strength 
                          and flexibility. Because weight is linked to spinal 
                          bone density, it is critical to monitor underweight 
                          children carefully. In particular, any adolescent female 
                          who is very lean, has an eating disorder or has amenorrhea 
                          should be considered at high risk for osteoporosis (Ponder

                        <p class="graycopy"> Physical activity, which includes 
                          the opportunity to develop an active lifestyle, to be 
                          physically fit and to acquire fundamental motor skills, 
                          can positively impact the overall health of girls in 
                          several ways. For example, increased fitness levels 
                          can contribute to better posture, the reduction of back 
                          pain and the development of adequate strength and flexibility, 
                          qualities which allow girls to participate fully in 
                          their daily activities, both vocational and recreational. 
                          The information presented below represents a summary 
                          of the contributions of sport and physical activity 
                          to the health and fitness of girls, as well as some 
                          recommendations for ensuring that all girls benefit 
                          from such involvement. <br>

                          Health and Well-Being (Research Quarterly for Exercise 
                          and Sport, 1995), physical activity positively influences 
                          physical and psychosocial health at all stages of the 
                          life cycle; thus, the promotion of physical activity

                          enhancing function and quality of life&#148; (p. v). 
                          As young girls and women have increased their involvement 
                          in physical activity and competitive sport, there have 
                          indeed been corresponding psychological benefits. Some 
                          of these benefits include enhanced motivation, increased 
                          self-esteem and improved mood states. Although participation 
                          in physical activity is an overwhelmingly positive experience 
                          for the vast majority of girls, some negative factors 
                          associated with participation in physical activity may 
                          include increased stress and anxiety, greater tolerance 
                          for aggression and the use of pathogenic (i.e., potentially 
                          injurious) weight control methods such as self-induced 
                          vomiting and the use of laxatives, diet pills and/or 
                          diuretics. Psychological benefits are integrally linked 
                          with the physical and social dimensions of female sport 
                          involvement and must be interpreted in light of these 
                          disciplines as well (Weiss &#38; Glenn, 1992). </span>

                          is quite limited (Dewar &#38; Horn, 1992; Gill, 1993), 
                          and there is even less on those girls from diverse racial

                          major themes that have emerged in the research literature 
                          of sport psychology: motivation, self-perceptions, moral 
                          development, emotional well-being, stress and anxiety, 
                          body image and disordered eating. Each of these major 
                          themes or areas of investigation is highlighted below. 
                          The concluding section presents specific directions 
                          for much needed research as well as practical suggestions 
                          for those working with young girls in physical activity 
                          contexts. 
                        <p> <span class="graycopy"><b>MOTIVATION</b> </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> It is clear from the vast body of 
                          information on why youths play organized sport that 
                          girls and boys are more alike in this respect than they 
                          are different. Children and adolescents often have multiple 
                          motives for participation in organized sport, with &#147;having 
                          fun&#148; rated as the most important motive for both 
                          boys and girls. Other primary reasons that children 
                          play organized sports typically include improving skills, 
                          being with friends, becoming physically fit, liking 
                          the challenges and experiencing success (Weiss &#38; 
                          Petlichkoff, 1989). A recent diverse, nationwide survey 
                          of ten thousand boys and girls ages ten to 18 found 
                          that when asked about their reasons for playing their 
                          best school sport, girls rated &#147;to have fun&#148; 
                          first, followed by &#147;to stay in shape,&#148; &#147;to 
                          get exercise&#148; and &#147;to improve skills&#148; 
                          as their next most important reasons (Ewing &#38; Seefeldt, 
                          1989). &#147;The Wilson Report: Moms, Dads, Daughters 
                          and Sports&#148; (1988) also found that girls who participate 
                          in sports most often report fun as their major motive, 
                          with physical, health and social factors frequently 
                          mentioned. The majority of motives cited, and certainly 
                          the most important motives, are intrinsic or internally-based, 
                          rather than extrinsic or externally-based. Only limited 
                          research is available on motives for exercise, as opposed 
                          to competitive sport involvement, in youngsters (Rowland, 
                          1990), though one study of junior high-school students 
                          revealed that girls exercised primarily because they 
                          wanted to look better whereas boys wanted to have fun 
                          (Godin &#38; Shephard, 1986). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Those children who leave organized 
                          sport, either temporarily or permanently, also tend 
                          to have multiple reasons for sport withdrawal. Though 
                          these reasons are primarily centered on conflicts of 
                          interest and wanting to do other things, children also 
                          cite injury, lack of fun and skills not improving as 
                          reasons for withdrawal (Weiss &#38; Petlichkoff, 1989). 
                          Petlichkoff (1996) placed sport withdrawal on a continuum, 
                          because many children who drop out of one sport often 
                          move on to try another sport or activity and are really 
                          &#147;sport transfers&#148; rather than sport dropouts. 
                          Children and adolescents who withdraw from sport entirely 
                          tend to have lower perceptions of their sport ability 
                          than those who remain involved. The important role of 
                          having confidence in one&#146;s physical abilities will 
                          be examined in the self-perceptions section. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Examining motivation on a more theoretical 
                          level, Gill (1992) defined the construct of sport orientation 
                          noting three distinct dimensions: competitiveness, win 
                          orientation and goal orientation. Competitiveness is 
                          an achievement orientation focused on entering and striving 
                          for success in competitive sport. Win orientation represents 
                          a desire to win and avoid losing in competitive sport, 
                          while a goal orientation places an emphasis on achieving 
                          personal goals in competitive sport. There are consistent 
                          gender differences in sport orientation; notably, females 
                          typically score higher on goal orientation, while males 
                          typically score higher on competitiveness and win orientation. 
                          Research by Garcia (1994) provides an example of how 
                          this affects the learning of physical activities. This 
                          field study of a culturally, racially and socioeconomically 
                          diverse sample of preschool children found that girls 
                          were cooperative, sharing and caring when learning fundamental 
                          motor skills; competitiveness seemed to inhibit their 
                          ability to learn efficiently. Girls cooperated with 
                          and supported their friends who were practicing motor 
                          skills, while boys adopted a competitive, egocentric 
                          practice style. Interestingly, Asian girls and boys 
                          both adopted the cooperative learning style, reinforcing 
                          the notion of socially constructed and culturally developed 
                          gender differences in behavior patterns. Activities 
                          allowing for social interaction and cooperative learning 
                          can enhance girls&#146; learning of motor skills. Gill 
                          (1992) has suggested that &#147;competition and a focus 
                          on winning may act as extrinsic motivating forces to 
                          decrease intrinsic motivation and that the undermining 
                          of intrinsic motivation is especially likely for females&#148; 
                          (p. 149). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Related to the overall motivation 
                          of youth in physical activity settings are their attributions 
                          or perceived causes for success and failure in achievement 
                          areas such as sport. These attributions are important 
                          because they affect emotions as well as future expectations 
                          and motivated behavior. Competitive athletes typically 
                          make more internal than external attributions for both 
                          success and failure in sport; however, some interesting 
                          ethnic and gender differences have emerged. For example, 
                          in their survey of the attributional literature in competitive 
                          sport, Morgan, Griffin and Heyward (1996) noted that 
                          when explaining why they are successful in sport, Caucasian 
                          females, Hispanic athletes and Navajo athletes emphasize 
                          the controllable aspect of effort while African-American 
                          and Caucasian males emphasize their ability. Related 
                          to failure in sport, Caucasian females, Navajo athletes 
                          and Hispanic athletes tend to emphasize low ability, 
                          whereas Caucasian males attribute the cause of failure 
                          to low effort. Morgan et al. (1996) reported the results 
                          of their own study of the role of ethnicity, gender 
                          and experience in attributions for success and failure 
                          among male and female high-school track and field athletes 
                          (ages 13 to 18). Success in sport was deemed more internal, 
                          controllable and stable than failure for both girls 
                          and boys across all levels of experience. However, Caucasian 
                          children perceived success in sport as more internal 
                          and controllable than either African-American or Native-American 
                          children. Outside of the competitive sport context, 
                          attributions are also important in understanding the 
                          motivated behavior of children in broad based physical 
                          activity programs. One study looked at eight to 13 year- 
                          old boys and girls attending an educational summer sports 
                          program. Findings showed that children higher in self-esteem 
                          made attributions for their physical competence that 
                          were more internal, stable and personally controllable 
                          than did low self-esteem children (Weiss, McAuley, Ebbeck, 
                          &#38; Wiese, 1990). This key finding documented that 
                          children in physical activity settings tend to make 
                          attributions consistent with the way they view their 
                          abilities, supporting the importance of enhancing self- 
                          perceptions as a means of encouraging motivation for 
                          physical activity participation. Parents, teachers and 
                          coaches who provide encouragement and feedback to girls 
                          practicing physical skills should focus on combining 
                          contingent feedback and praise with skill-relevant information 
                          on how to improve in future attempts in order to enhance 
                          the self-perceptions and motivated behavior of girls 
                          (Horn, 1987). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In sum, it appears that girls typically 
                          have multiple motives for participation in physical 
                          activity and that for optimum enjoyment of the physical 
                          activity experience, varied opportunity to meet these 
                          motives should be provided. The motivational orientation 
                          of girls, however, may be somewhat different from boys 
                          in physical activity settings and consideration needs 
                          to be given to developing programs to meet their needs. 
                          Motivational dimensions of girls&#146; participation 
                          are integrally linked with self- perceptions, which 
                          is the topic of the next section. 
                        <p> <span class="graycopy"><b>SELF-PERCEPTIONS</b> </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The following section summarizes 
                          the available information on several slightly different 
                          yet related constructs: self-esteem, self-concept, self-confidence, 
                          perceptions of competence and self-efficacy. One leading 
                          expert in sport psychology has suggested that all of 
                          the self-perception constructs essentially refer to 
                          the &#147;description of, evaluation of and affect toward 
                          one&#146;s competencies&#148; (Weiss, 1993, p. 41). 
                          Regardless of the label used, these are all important 
                          for understanding the psychological dimensions of young 
                          girls&#146; participation in physical activity because 
                          self-perceptions are predictive of both positive emotions 
                          and actual behavior in achievement settings such as 
                          sport (Weiss, 1993). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Among secondary physical education 
                          instructors, 59 percent said that self-esteem (or self-regard 
                          related to &#147;Who am I&#148; and &#147;How do I regard 
                          myself&#148;) was a primary benefit of physical fitness 
                          (Chrysler Fund&#151;Amateur Athletic Union, 1989). McAuley 
                          (1994) also reported that self-esteem development was 
                          one of several positive psychosocial outcomes related 
                          to exercise and physical activity participation. He 
                          noted that 69 percent of the studies reviewed supported 
                          a positive relationship between physical activity and 
                          psychological well-being. Another examination of multiple 
                          studies on this topic found a positive association between 
                          physical activity and self-esteem in children (Gruber, 
                          1986). Gruber noted that emotionally disturbed, mentally 
                          handicapped, perceptually handicapped and economically 
                          disadvantaged children showed greater gains in self-concept 
                          as a result of physical activity than other children. 
                          Three recent studies by the Melpomene Institute examined 
                          the relationship between self-esteem and physical activity 
                          in female children (Jaffee &#38; Manzer, 1992) and adolescents 
                          (Jaffee &#38; Ricker, 1993; Jaffee &#38; Wu, 1996) from 
                          diverse geographic, economic and racial backgrounds. 
                          The findings were remarkably similar across both age 
                          groups (ages nine to 12 and 12 to 17, respectively). 
                          The primary reason girls engaged in physical activity 
                          was to have fun, followed by positive health benefits. 
                          All three studies found a strong positive relationship 
                          between physical activity and self-esteem. Girls who 
                          felt most confident about themselves and their abilities 
                          were more likely to participate in physical activities 
                          at higher levels than girls who felt less confident. 
                          Younger girls derived positive self- esteem through 
                          challenge, achievement in sports, risk-taking experiences 
                          and skill development, while older girls cited these 
                          sources of self-esteem as well as gaining esteem from 
                          the approval of others and through a belief that girls 
                          are capable of playing sports well. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Exercise programs, particularly weight 
                          and strength training, can enhance the self-concepts 
                          of adolescent female participants as well (Gill, 1993). 
                          For example, Brown and Harrison (1986) found that participation 
                          in a 12-week program of weight training significantly 
                          enhanced self-concept in both younger and older girls 
                          and women. Another study examined the use of competitive 
                          and cooperative physical fitness programs with high-school 
                          girls (Marsh &#38; Peart, 1988). Both the competitive 
                          and cooperative programs resulted in enhanced physical 
                          fitness; however, the cooperative program enhanced physical 
                          ability self-concept and physical appearance self-concept, 
                          while the competitive program lowered them. The competitiveness 
                          of physical education programs was one of the more negative 
                          aspects of the experience for girls. Reinforcing this 
                          finding was a study of young girls (Jaffee &#38; Manzer, 
                          1992) in which several reported not liking the competitive 
                          nature of fitness testing in their physical education 
                          classes. When asked to complete physical education task 
                          challenges, these girls preferred working with small 
                          groups as opposed to engaging in individualistic, competitive 
                          activities. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Moving from more global measures 
                          of self-esteem and self-concept as associated with physical 
                          activity participation, researchers have also examined 
                          more specific aspects of self-confidence in physical 
                          activity abilities. There is, however, some debate as 
                          to the interaction of physical activity and confidence. 
                          For example, a recent synthesis of multiple studies 
                          by Lirgg (1991) examined the magnitude of gender differences 
                          in self-confidence in physical activity and found that 
                          gender differences were fairly small, with boys having 
                          greater confidence. One explanation for this finding 
                          was the perceived gender appropriateness of physical 
                          activity tasks. As summarized by Gill (1992), &#147;when 
                          tasks are perceived as appropriate for females, when 
                          females and males have similar experiences and capabilities 
                          and when clear evaluation criteria and feedback are 
                          present, females and males display similar levels of 
                          confidence&#148; (p. 150). Further examination of the 
                          perceived &#147;appropriateness&#148; of physical tasks 
                          is necessary to help clarify these relationships (see 
                          also Section III: Sociological Dimensions). It is also 
                          important to note the possibility that girls&#146; assessments 
                          of their abilities are more accurate than boys&#146;, 
                          who may tend to overestimate their actual abilities. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Research by Eccles and Harold (1991) 
                          has evaluated the way gender role stereotypes affect 
                          sport confidence, even at an early age. In a survey 
                          of 875 elementary school children (third to sixth grades), 
                          even though girls scored only two percent lower than 
                          boys on a battery of motor skills tests, girls self- 
                          rated their skills as 14 percent lower than boys. Apparently 
                          even by the first grade, girls assess their general 
                          athletic ability more negatively than do boys in spite 
                          of their objective equality in skill. Both boys and 
                          girls felt it more important for boys than girls to 
                          have ability in sport. The more girls saw sport as appropriate 
                          for girls, the higher their estimates were of their 
                          own ability in sports. To the extent that children thought 
                          their parents valued sport competence they rated their 
                          own sport competence higher. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Other research has also documented 
                          the critical role of parents and other significant individuals 
                          such as coaches and peers in developing girls&#146; 
                          physical self-perceptions. For example, in terms of 
                          the role of significant others in encouraging physical 
                          activity, one interesting difference between younger 
                          (Jaffee &#38; Manzer, 1992) and older (Jaffee &#38; 
                          Ricker, 1993) girls noted in the Melpomene studies was 
                          that younger girls cited parents as a more important 
                          source of encouragement and information than did older 
                          girls, who cited peers as more influential. Weiss and 
                          Ebbeck (1996) have documented this tendency for children 
                          of different ages to use different information sources 
                          as a basis for physical competence judgments. Children 
                          under the age of ten rely more on adult comments, from 
                          ages ten to 14 rely more on peer comparison and evaluation 
                          and from ages 16 to 18 rely more on self-referenced 
                          information. There do not appear to be gender differences 
                          in these dominant sources of information in early childhood. 
                          In adolescence, however, females place greater emphasis 
                          on the use of self-comparison and comments from adults 
                          than males, who rely on competitive outcomes and ease 
                          of learning skills as their basis for personal judgments 
                          of physical competence (Weiss &#38; Ebbeck, 1996). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Given that girls rely on adult comments, 
                          it is important to realize that parents in particular 
                          play an important role in the affective responses of 
                          children to physical activity participation (Brustad, 
                          1996). Children are more likely to enjoy their sport 
                          experience if they perceive that their parents have 
                          realistic expectations, provide support and encouragement 
                          for their efforts and respond infrequently with negative 
                          evaluations of their performance. Unfortunately, girls 
                          perceive themselves to have lower competence in sport, 
                          assign less importance to sport and perceive less parental 
                          encouragement for participation than do boys (Brustad, 
                          1993a). Attitudes toward physical activity were somewhat 
                          different among parents of girls from various cultural 
                          groups in the Melpomene studies (Jaffee &#38; Ricker, 
                          1993). A focus group of Hmong girls, for example, said 
                          their parents held differential attitudes about physical 
                          activity for boys and girls. Parents deemed participation 
                          in physical activity as &#147;childish&#148; for older 
                          girls in the Hmong culture, but acceptable for older 
                          boys. &#147;The Wilson Report: Moms, Dads, Daughters 
                          and Sports&#148; (1988) identified race and gender differences 
                          in parental attitudes toward physical activity for their 
                          children as well. In their survey of more than one thousand 
                          parents, African-American parents were significantly 
                          more likely than Caucasian parents to say that sports 
                          were more important for boys than girls. Peer groups 
                          are also important influences on self-perceptions, as 
                          highlighted by Weiss and Duncan (1992). In a study of 
                          eight to 13-year-old males and females enrolled in an 
                          educational summer sport program, children higher in 
                          both actual and perceived physical competence had better 
                          levels of acceptance among their peers. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> To summarize, self-perceptions are 
                          strongly connected to motivated behavior in physical 
                          activity settings. It appears to be a cyclic relationship, 
                          in that better perceptions of oneself and one&#146;s 
                          abilities lead to enhanced effort, persistence and achievement, 
                          which in turn further benefit self-perceptions. The 
                          role of significant others is critical in positively 
                          affecting this cycle. Parents, coaches, and peers should 
                          be realistic, supportive and encouraging in reinforcing 
                          girls&#146; capabilities in physical activity.

                        <p class="graycopy"> Participation in sport and physical 
                          activity certainly has the potential to act in a positive 
                          fashion, affecting moral development through such processes 
                          as observing positive role models in coaches, parents 
                          and other children (Martens, 1993) and having the opportunity 
                          to engage in prosocial, or ethical, behavior. However, 
                          adult leaders must explicitly encourage this development. 
                          For example, in a field study of students in a fifth-grade 
                          physical education class, systematically structured 
                          activities elicited more mature moral reasoning strategies 
                          than did traditional teaching approaches (Romance, Weiss, 
                          &#38; Bockoven, 1986). These structured moral development 
                          activities emphasized the students&#146; rights and 
                          responsibilities in the gymnasium and consisted of incorporating 
                          moral dilemmas and resolution strategies into basketball, 
                          gymnastics and physical fitness instruction units. A 
                          recent investigation involving more than four hundred 
                          female and male physical education class students in 
                          fourth, fifth and sixth grades similarly noted that 
                          the implementation of a specially designed moral education 
                          program resulted in positive changes in several facets 
                          of moral development (Gibbons, Ebbeck, &#38; Weiss, 
                          1995). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Although sport is often proclaimed 
                          a character-building activity, organized children&#146;s 
                          sports programs may develop negative character instead. 
                          When children observe other children and adults cheating, 
                          engaging in aggressive behavior and successfully using 
                          intimidation to achieve desired goals (Martens, 1993), 
                          it may undermine the positive moral development which 
                          can occur. A number of scholars have provided empirical 
                          support for such claims. For example, Bredemeier and 
                          Shields (1993) examined the relationship between moral 
                          reasoning (i.e., the decision process that determines 
                          the rightness or wrongness of a course of action) and 
                          tolerance for aggressive actions. A study of children 
                          ages nine to 13 (Bredemeier, 1994) found that those 
                          more mature in moral reasoning described themselves 
                          as more assertive and less aggressive in response to 
                          conflict situations than children with less mature moral 
                          reasoning. Among girls and boys in grades four to seven, 
                          girls&#146; participation in medium contact sports (i.e., 
                          basketball and soccer, the highest level of contact 
                          sport reported for girls) was associated with less mature 
                          moral reasoning and greater tendency to aggress (Bredemeier, 
                          Weiss, Shields, &#38; Cooper, 1986). In a study examining 
                          the relationship between motivational orientation and 
                          moral behavior among ten to 14-year old female soccer 
                          players (Stephens &#38; Bredemeier, 1996), those players 
                          who were more ego-oriented (similar to the &#147;win&#148; 
                          orientation described earlier) were more tempted to 
                          violate moral norms (e.g., lying to an official, hurting 
                          an opponent or breaking one of the rules). 
                        <p> <span class="graycopy">&#147;Game reasoning&#148; 
                          is one explanation that has been offered to describe 
                          the less mature moral reasoning and increased tolerance 
                          for aggression common in sport; the unique, egocentric 
                          context of competitive sport encourages &#147;legitimized 
                          regression&#148; to less mature moral reasoning (Bredemeier 
                          &#38; Shields, 1996). For example, among the soccer 
                          players described above (Stephens &#38; Bredemeier, 
                          1996), greater temptation to play unfairly was associated 
                          with greater approval of behaviors designed to obtain 
                          an unfair advantage over an opponent and the belief 
                          that many of their teammates would play unfairly in 
                          the same situation. This &#147;game reasoning&#148; 
                          view represents a double standard and is problematic 
                          both in terms of the messages it conveys to young athletes 
                          and in terms of the increased risk of injury and harm.

                        <p class="graycopy"> Other research in sport has supported 
                          more general findings that females accept and express 
                          less aggression than males (Bredemeier &#38; Shields, 
                          1993). In a study of male and female high school basketball 
                          players and nonathletes, no moral reasoning differences 
                          between athletes and nonathletes were observed. However, 
                          high-school females reasoned at a more mature level 
                          than males in response to both sport and life dilemmas 
                          (Bredemeier &#38; Shields, 1986). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The key to establishing positive 
                          relationships between physical activity participation 
                          and moral development seems to be in the provision of 
                          quality, adult leadership that places high priority 
                          on the development of prosocial or ethical behavior 
                          in sport and physical activity settings. As Gibbons 
                          et al. (1995) concluded, &#147;enhancing moral growth 
                          is not an automatic consequence of participation in 
                          physical activity&#148; (p. 253). To attain these positive 
                          benefits, deliberate and systematic focus on moral development 
                          is essential.

                        <p class="graycopy"> Physical fitness is positively associated 
                          with mental health and well-being. Exercise has beneficial 
                          emotional effects across all ages, in both sexes and 
                          among those differing in health status (Biddle, 1995; 
                          Morgan, 1994). It is apparent from the existing research 
                          that adults and youth alike consider mental health an 
                          important benefit of physical activity participation. 
                          &#147;The Wilson Report: Moms, Dads, Daughters and Sports&#148; 
                          (1988) surveyed parents of girls ages seven to 18 and 
                          found that 41 percent of the parents believed that promoting 
                          mental health was an important benefit of sport involvement 
                          for their daughters (see also Section IV: Mental Health 
                          Dimensions). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> An examination of the exercise and 
                          mental health literature specifically related to young 
                          females and subgroups of young females (e.g., those 
                          with physical disabilities) reveals a paucity of research 
                          (Willis &#38; Campbell, 1992). However, the few studies 
                          that have been conducted in this area yield promising 
                          results. Two experimental programs involving minority 
                          adolescent youth combined physical activity with stress 
                          management and other health education strategies and 
                          found that these components resulted in positive physical 
                          and psychosocial outcomes (Fardy et al., 1995; Fardy, 
                          1988). A cross- sectional study of 220 adolescent females 
                          investigated the relationship between physical activity 
                          and physical and emotional distress accompanying periods 
                          of high stress. Participants classified as low exercisers 
                          experienced significantly more stress and ill effects 
                          than high exercisers or those who adhered to a regimen 
                          of vigorous physical activity (Brown &#38; Lawton, 1986). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> As illustrated by the above findings, 
                          physically active individuals typically have lower levels 
                          of depression (Morgan, 1994) and anxiety (Landers &#38; 
                          Petruzzello, 1994) than sedentary individuals. Given 
                          this relationship, there is a growing interest among 
                          health care professionals in the role played by physical 
                          activity in preventing the onset of emotional problems 
                          and in serving as a treatment adjunct once such problems 
                          have developed (Landers &#38; Petruzzello, 1994). For 
                          example, in the treatment of anxiety disorders, many 
                          physicians routinely prescribe exercise as part of a 
                          patient&#146;s therapy (Ryan, 1983). One study of youth 
                          (ages six to 13) found that incorporating running into 
                          a treatment program for emotional and behavioral disorders 
                          improved their emotional states (Shipman, 1984). In 
                          a recent review paper, Biddle (1995) documented that 
                          exercise is associated with small to moderate reductions 
                          in anxiety. When comparing anxiety scores before and 
                          after engaging in an exercise program, participants 
                          tend to report lower anxiety scores after an aerobic 
                          exercise training program. It is not clear, however, 
                          that exercise produces larger anxiety reductions than 
                          other interventions such as meditation, resting or reading 
                          (Weinberg &#38; Gould, 1995). It does seem that individuals 
                          who are initially in poor physical condition or are 
                          highly anxious achieve the greatest reductions in anxiety 
                          from an exercise training program. In dealing with depression, 
                          various modes of exercise have been shown to have a 
                          moderate effect in reducing depression (Biddle, 1995). 
                          It has been demonstrated, for example, that among individuals 
                          who are moderately depressed at the time of exercise 
                          program initiation, the adoption of aerobic exercise 
                          is associated with decreased depression. (See also Section 
                          IV: Mental Health Dimensions.) 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Conversely, it is also essential 
                          to consider the possible negative consequences of exercise 
                          involvement as studies have linked some negative outcomes 
                          to excessive exercise. According to Johnsgard (1989), 
                          &#147;exercise is not inherently dangerous or abusive,&#148; 
                          but it is not without its risks (p. 269). Several studies 
                          have shown that mood states can worsen with increased 
                          training volumes (Morgan, 1994). For example, healthy, 
                          nondepressed individuals may become depressed as a result 
                          of high training loads (i.e., overtraining). Exercise 
                          that becomes an addiction or compulsion may also lead 
                          to adverse psychological effects. Sachs and Pargman 
                          (1984) refer to excessive chronic exercise as an addiction 
                          which can &#147;control the person&#146;s life&#148; 
                          (p. 249). Addictive exercise&#151;excessive chronic 
                          exercise&#151;may lead to such problems as decreased 
                          ability to concentrate, social problems, fatigue, judgment 
                          difficulties, anxiety and depression (Sachs &#38; Pargman, 
                          1984; Shisslak &#38; Crago, 1992; Singer, 1992). It 
                          must be emphasized, however, that moderate exercise 
                          has never been shown to cause these types of psychological 
                          harm (Martinsen &#38; Stephens, 1994). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In general, it appears that participation 
                          in physical activity can have a mental health buffering 
                          effect before the onset of problems, and a beneficial 
                          treatment effect in alleviating existing negative emotional 
                          states. Participation in excessive levels of exercise, 
                          however, can have deleterious effects on emotional well-being. 
                          Involvement in highly competitive youth sport can also 
                          result in negative effects, as illustrated in the subsequent 
                          section. 
                        <p> <span class="graycopy"><b>STRESS AND ANXIETY</b> </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In addition to the anxiety-reducing 
                          benefits of exercise just described, there are important 
                          considerations in the competitive sport domain as well. 
                          Competitive sport is an important achievement area for 
                          children because physical competence is publicly demonstrated 
                          and socially evaluated (Scanlan &#38; Passer, 1979). 
                          For the majority of young athletes, this situation does 
                          not pose a problem; however, left unchecked, highly 
                          competitive sport contexts can lead to stress and anxiety. 
                          For example, in a significant number of children and 
                          youth, particularly at the elite levels of competitive 
                          sport, stress, anxiety and burnout are of major concern. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Stress is a process where there is 
                          an imbalance between the perceived demand of the situation 
                          and perceived ability of the individual to meet that 
                          demand, particularly under conditions in which failure 
                          to meet the demand has important consequences. Anxiety 
                          has two major components: trait anxiety, considered 
                          to be an enduring attitude or personality disposition, 
                          and state anxiety, or a negative feeling experienced 
                          at a particular point in time. Trait anxiety has been 
                          consistently shown to influence one&#146;s level of 
                          state anxiety (Gould, 1993). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Personal and situational factors 
                          affect stress and anxiety both before and after a competitive 
                          contest. Intrapersonal factors, which reflect perceived 
                          inadequacy in successfully meeting demands of competition, 
                          are related to pregame stress. These factors include 
                          high competitive trait anxiety, low self- esteem and 
                          low personal and team performance expectancies (Scanlan 
                          &#38; Passer, 1979). In a study of female basketball 
                          players, Brustad (1988) found that players with high 
                          competitive trait anxiety had lower self-esteem and 
                          more frequent worries about evaluation and performance 
                          than did their counterparts with low competitive trait 
                          anxiety. Highly trait-anxious youngsters have less favorable 
                          views of their own competence and frequent worries about 
                          personal performance; in addition, they appear to worry 
                          extensively about receiving negative performance evaluations 
                          from others (Brustad, 1993b). Postgame stress is most 
                          influenced by actual response in meeting demands of 
                          competition. In one early study, game outcome dramatically 
                          influenced postgame stress reactions in girls, such 
                          that losers felt significantly higher stress than did 
                          winners (Scanlan &#38; Passer, 1979). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Burnout is a special form of sport 
                          withdrawal and is a response to constant stress in which 
                          a young athlete ceases to participate in a previously 
                          enjoyable activity. The child may withdraw from sport 
                          physically, psychologically or emotionally because of 
                          her perception that it is impossible to meet the physical 
                          and psychological demands associated with such activity 
                          (Smith, 1986). On the basis of interviews with 15 adolescent 
                          athletes who had &#147;burned out&#148; of sports in 
                          which they had been intensively training, Coakley (1992) 
                          found that these children (a) saw themselves and were 
                          viewed by others only in terms of their specialized 
                          athletic roles, and (b) were involved in power relationships 
                          with others that left them feeling little sense of control 
                          over their own lives. Both situational and personal 
                          factors are associated with burnout in young athletes 
                          (Gould, 1993). Situational characteristics include such 
                          things as extremely high training volumes and time demands, 
                          demanding performance expectations that are either imposed 
                          by self or others, constant intense competition, inconsistent 
                          coaching practices and little personal control in sport 
                          decision-making. Personal characteristics include perfectionism, 
                          a need to please others, nonassertiveness and unidimensional 
                          self-conceptualizations focusing only on one&#146;s 
                          athletic involvement. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Another troubling aspect of highly 
                          intense sport experiences can be a &#147;win at all 
                          costs&#148; philosophy which is emphasized in some elite 
                          female athletic arenas. Controversial training methods 
                          sometimes include verbal abuse and result in extensive 
                          physical and emotional damage to these young women. 
                          Ryan, a sports journalist, has reported that sometimes 
                          girls are called &#147;fat cows&#148; by the coaching 
                          staff. Not surprisingly, these athletes begin to get 
                          a distorted view of what they should (and do) look like. 
                          These elite girls&#151;particularly in gymnastics and 
                          figure skating&#151;are in a &#147;race against time 
                          to transform into perfect little machines&#148; (Ryan, 
                          1995, p. 31). However, machines do not have emotional 
                          breakdowns, sustain psychological damage or commit suicide, 
                          yet these are experiences for some elite young female 
                          athletes. Coaches and trainers are in important positions 
                          of influence and power over these girls (Shisslak &#38; 
                          Crago, 1992), and it is incumbent upon them to use such 
                          influence wisely and in the best interest of the athletes, 
                          rather than for personal glory or gain. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The focus of educators and coaches 
                          working with young athletes affected by stress and anxiety 
                          should be on emphasizing personal improvement rather 
                          than absolute outcome. It is also essential to help 
                          these girls maintain a healthy balance between the intense 
                          demands of sport and other important areas of their 
                          lives, such as academics and social development. 
                        <p> <span class="graycopy"><b>BODY IMAGE</b> </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> From a psychological perspective, 
                          there are very important concerns about the relationship 
                          of body image to females&#146; attitudes about physical 
                          activity and to actual behavior in sport and exercise 
                          settings (Gill, 1993). Physical activity is associated 
                          with enhanced self-esteem and body image (Plaisted, 
                          1995; Snyder &#38; Spreitzer, 1977) though female adolescents 
                          in general report greater body image disturbances and 
                          dissatisfaction than do males (Overdorf &#38; Gill, 
                          1994; Plaisted, 1995). Females are generally more negative 
                          about their bodies and are concerned with physical beauty 
                          and maintaining an ideal, thin shape (as identified 
                          by media and societal images), whereas males are concerned 
                          with size, strength and power (Gill, 1995). According 
                          to Hart, Leary and Rejeski (1989), such dissatisfaction 
                          with body image is associated with both low self-esteem 
                          and depression. Both social and sport-based pressures 
                          on female athletes to be thin can be implicated in this 
                          excessive focus on appearance (Plaisted, 1995). For 
                          example, societal pressure idealizing a body image that 
                          is not particularly healthy or attainable for many females 
                          has important consequences in terms of self-esteem and 
                          disordered eating (see also Section III: Sociological 
                          Dimensions). Although the &#147;ideal&#148; physique 
                          in today&#146;s society is a slender, lean female body, 
                          it is much less than ideal with respect to physical 
                          and mental health (Gill, 1993). Sport-based pressures 
                          may include factors such as negative comments from coaches, 
                          teammates and officials and the standards and demands 
                          of the specific sport. Females that do not match this 
                          ideal, particularly those who are overweight or obese, 
                          are evaluated negatively and discriminated against (Gill, 
                          1993). For example, some elite female swimmers lose 
                          self-esteem &#147;due to derogatory comments or punitive 
                          measures for failing to meet what may be an unfair or 
                          unhealthy assigned weight standard&#148; (Benson, 1991, 
                          p. 107). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> One key problem regarding body image 
                          lies in the conflict between perception and reality. 
                          Even in the face of objective evidence to the contrary, 
                          many young females perceive themselves to be overweight. 
                          Overdorf and Gill (1994) found that female adolescent 
                          athletes perceived their bodies as heavier than they 
                          actually were. In their sample of children predominantly 
                          within normal weight ranges, 43.8 percent admitted to 
                          using some form of pathogenic weight control method 
                          at least occasionally because they felt the need to 
                          lose weight. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Body image may differ among girls 
                          of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. A recent 
                          study of a diverse sample of adolescent girls (ages 
                          11 to 17) has identified some of the factors related 
                          to low and high body image (Jaffee &#38; Lutter, 1995). 
                          Girls who received positive comments about their appearance 
                          and achievements from their parents had more positive 
                          body images than did those who received negative comments. 
                          Playing on more school and nonschool sport teams was 
                          also associated with a better body image. With respect 
                          to ethnic differences, it was found that more African-American 
                          girls (44.0 percent) reported having a good body image 
                          than did Native American girls (33.3 percent) or Caucasian 
                          girls (31.8 percent). More than four times as many African-American 
                          girls as Caucasian girls considered themselves attractive 
                          and 12 times as many African-American girls as Caucasian 
                          girls reported liking the way they looked. With respect 
                          to perceived physical competence, 36.0 percent of the 
                          African-American girls said that they felt competent 
                          and capable about their bodies, while only 7.6 percent 
                          of the Caucasian girls did. The dramatic differences 
                          noted in this study illustrate the need to jointly consider 
                          sociological factors such as race and ethnicity with 
                          psychological factors to better understand the causes 
                          of variable self-perceptions. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> It is also important to consider 
                          the relationship between physical activity participation 
                          and body image for overweight or obese girls, since 
                          overweight females have often been excluded from physical 
                          activity based on their physical characteristics, social 
                          pressures and psychological perceptions (Gill, 1993). 
                          Since the prevalence of overweight children has increased 
                          over the past 30 years among (a) females of all age 
                          groups, and (b) females of color in particular, this 
                          is certainly a cause for concern (Wells, 1996) (see 
                          also Section I: Physiological Dimensions). While exercise 
                          is recommended as an important factor in the physical 
                          management of childhood obesity (Rowland, 1990), there 
                          may be corresponding psychological benefits as well 
                          (King &#38; Tribble, 1990). However, since obese children 
                          typically possess negative attitudes toward physical 
                          activity, it is important to gradually introduce them 
                          to enjoyable forms of exercise so that they begin to 
                          feel more confident in their physical abilities and 
                          their self-image. When this happens, their sense of 
                          self-mastery can also improve (King &#38; Tribble, 1990; 
                          Rowland, 1990). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Clearly these findings imply that 
                          negative body images are common even among physically 
                          active girls (Plaisted, 1995). Many physical activity 
                          leaders unwittingly contribute to these negative images. 
                          As will be illustrated in the next section, such preoccupation 
                          with physique can lead to dangerous attempts to control 
                          weight. 
                        <p> <span class="graycopy"><b>DISORDERED EATING</b> </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Disturbed body images&#151;and the 
                          associated low self-esteem&#151;lay the groundwork for 
                          weight preoccupation and disordered eating. Under these 
                          conditions, physical activity participation can often 
                          cross a very dangerous line. An increased level of physical 
                          activity is typical during the dieting and weight loss 
                          stage of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa (Polivy, 
                          1994). In this sense, excessive physical activity can 
                          have potentially harmful consequences. As Polivy suggested, 
                          &#147;There is a range of compulsiveness connected to 
                          physical activity, with some individuals crossing a 
                          hypothetical line between what is normal and acceptable 
                          and what is destructive or pathological&#148; (p. 883). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> There are far more athletes who hold 
                          unhealthy attitudes and use unhealthy weight-loss methods 
                          (e.g., excessive exercise) than there are athletes with 
                          true eating disorders (Plaisted, 1995), although both 
                          are certainly of concern since they represent points 
                          along a continuum. Female athletes may be a high-risk 
                          group for developing either disordered eating patterns 
                          or actual eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia 
                          (Shisslak &#38; Crago, 1992; Thurstin, 1992), especially 
                          in: (a) sports with certain weight requirements, like 
                          lightweight rowing or horse racing, (b) sports in which 
                          low body fat is encouraged, like running and swimming, 
                          and (c) sports in which aesthetic appeal is important, 
                          like gymnastics, diving, ballet, body building and figure 
                          skating (Plaisted, 1995). Females in these sports sometimes 
                          use unhealthy weight loss methods such as self-induced 
                          vomiting and the abuse of diuretics, diet pills and 
                          laxatives. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Some of the influential factors in 
                          the development of disordered eating are unhealthy family 
                          dynamics, peer and teammate modeling and acceptance 
                          and pressure from coaches (Plaisted, 1995). For example, 
                          a study of elite female swimmers ranging in age from 
                          14 to 30 noted that almost 70 percent of the swimmers 
                          had coaches who told them to lose weight, in spite of 
                          the fact that 36 percent reported that pressure to lose 
                          weight was detrimental to helping them meet performance 
                          goals (Benson, 1991). A recent survey of youth coaches&#146; 
                          attitudes, knowledge, experiences and recommendations 
                          regarding weight control revealed a tendency for these 
                          coaches to make decisions about the need for weight 
                          control in their athletes on the basis of appearance 
                          rather than more objective indicators (Griffin &#38; 
                          Harris, 1996). Coaches also were more likely to say 
                          that female athletes needed to lose weight but male 
                          athletes needed to gain weight. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Examples from research in a variety 
                          of sports illustrate that there are additional factors 
                          that may contribute to disordered eating. In a sample 
                          of adolescent and college-age female gymnasts, Harris 
                          and Greco (1990) found that gymnasts were extremely 
                          concerned about their weight, although on objective 
                          measures, they were actually low in weight. Many considered 
                          themselves too fat and over half of them reported that 
                          they felt pressure from their coaches to lose weight. 
                          Similarly, a study of nine to 18-year old competitive 
                          swimmers (Dummer, Rosen, Heusner, Roberts, &#38; Counsilman, 
                          1987) found that females were particularly likely to 
                          misperceive themselves as overweight. These athletes 
                          based decisions to lose weight on these misperceptions 
                          as well as others&#146; opinions of their weight. Furthermore, 
                          15.4 percent of these girls used pathogenic weight loss 
                          methods to address weight concerns tied more to appearance 
                          than performance. Another study of adolescent swimmers 
                          (Taub &#38; Benson, 1992) found that young female swimmers 
                          desired weight loss more than their male counterparts 
                          did, but neither males nor females reported much use 
                          of pathogenic weight control methods. Overdorf (1991) 
                          reported that the body self-perceptions of high school 
                          and collegiate female athletes differed markedly from 
                          the objective evidence, such that over half of the athletes 
                          saw themselves as heavy while only three percent were 
                          overweight by objective standards. Such standards are 
                          based on BMI (body mass index) which is widely used 
                          in the literature because it is moderately correlated 
                          with percent body fat (Brooks, Fahey, &#38; White, 1996). 
                          Approximately half of the sample also reported using 
                          pathogenic weight control methods, including exercise 
                          abuse. Elite adolescent figure skaters, ballet dancers 
                          and swimmers were compared with nonathletes by Brooks-Gunn, 
                          Burrow and Warren (1988) and findings revealed that 
                          compulsive dieting behaviors were more common in the 
                          two sports emphasizing thin body shape (i.e., figure 
                          skating and ballet dancing) than among swimmers or nonathletes. 
                          A recent study comparing female high-school and college 
                          cheerleaders noted that the high-school cheerleaders 
                          &#147;exhibited greater body dissatisfaction and disordered 
                          eating patterns&#148; (Reel &#38; Gill, 1996, p. 195) 
                          than did their college counterparts. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Participating in extreme measures 
                          such as disordered eating can have harmful, even life- 
                          threatening consequences. It is important to note that 
                          it is only a subgroup of female athletes who develop 
                          clinical eating disorders, although the numbers are 
                          significant enough to be a cause for concern. Estimates 
                          of female athletes with eating disorders typically range 
                          from 10 to 20 percent. It may be, however, that it is 
                          not the sport context that causes the disordered eating, 
                          but rather that &#147;individuals prone to eating disorders 
                          gravitate toward sports that require a low body weight&#148; 
                          (Shisslak &#38; Crago, 1992, p. 31). Given the available 
                          evidence, both avenues seem likely. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Societal attitudes toward physical 
                          appearance may also affect self-esteem, body image and 
                          eating behaviors in athletes with physical disabilities. 
                          In examining the literature on children with motor disability 
                          and their participation in sports, Steadward and Wheeler 
                          (1996) pointed out that coaches must consider complicating 
                          factors that affect dietary behaviors in addition to 
                          the existing cultural pressures on young athletes to 
                          attain ideal body shapes. They suggested a &#147;triple 
                          jeopardy&#148; of eating problems related to the child 
                          with a disability: the impact of physical activity on 
                          existing eating problems, disability-specific implications 
                          for eating problems and the role of cultural influences. 
                          Coaches of all athletes&#151;both able-bodied and disabled&#151;have 
                          an ethical duty not to promote questionable dietary 
                          practices or weight loss methods. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In spite of the above-mentioned factors 
                          that often contribute to disordered eating, it is important 
                          to remember that all females can nevertheless learn 
                          positive nutritional habits through their experiences 
                          in physical activity participation. For example, many 
                          coaches and athletic trainers include nutritional advice 
                          as part of their educational responsibility to young 
                          athletes. Those working with obese youngsters on weight 
                          management typically adopt a combined approach of dietary 
                          changes, exercise, behavior modification and education 
                          (Rowland, 1990). (See also Section I: Physiological 
                          Dimensions.) 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In summary, problems with disordered 
                          eating appear to affect a substantial number of young 
                          females. Participation in excessive levels of physical 
                          activity can be one dangerous method of weight control. 
                          Clearly, coaches must establish and encourage healthy 
                          nutritional habits among their female athletes.

                          be particularly helpful for those individuals working

                            in physical activity (Jaffee &#38; Ricker, 1993). 
                            Girls participate not only for fun, but also to get 
                            in shape, socialize and improve skills. We must provide 
                            opportunities to achieve these varied motives in physical 
                            activity programs. 
                          <li class="graycopy">Even though girls may lack confidence 
                            in their sport and exercise capabilities, it appears 
                            that physical activity has tremendous potential to 
                            enhance a girl&#146;s sense of competence and control 
                            (Gill, 1993). Physical activity leaders should incorporate 
                            cooperative as well as competitive opportunities for 
                            girls to learn and practice physical skills in a nonthreatening 
                            environment. 
                          <li class="graycopy">Sport administrators should emphasize 
                            moral education (e.g., prosocial) goals in physical 
                            activity and youth sport programs (Shields &#38; Bredemeier, 
                            1995). We must make prosocial, ethical reasoning processes 
                            and behavior an explicit, rather than implicit, part 
                            of the agenda. 
                          <li class="graycopy">Coaches, parents and health care 
                            professionals need to identify girls who are at risk 
                            for excessive stress; this includes particularly those 
                            girls who have low self-esteem or unrealistic expectations 
                            about their abilities as well as those who experience 
                            frequent criticism from others (Martens, 1993). The 
                            most important factor to communicate to children is 
                            that they should be striving to achieve personal rather 
                            than outcome goals.

                            by being careful about the kinds of remarks they make 
                            to female students-athletes and clients about their 
                            weight and appearance. Additionally, because these

                            disordered eating patterns (Weinberg &#38; Gould, 
                            1995), they must be knowledgeable about the physical 
                            and psychological signs that accompany such behavior 
                            and be able to make referrals when appropriate.

                            rates. Research studies need to be designed which 
                            better distinguish between sport-specific or sport-general 
                            dropouts versus sport transfers to ascertain if girls 
                            are leaving organized sport entirely or simply sampling 
                            a variety of sporting activities (Weinberg &#38; Gould, 
                            1995). These investigations should collect and analyze 
                            participation statistics and conduct exit interviews 
                            with children who drop out in order to identify negative 
                            reasons for cessation and address them in future programs.

                            in sport and physical activity because prior research 
                            indicates girls often lack self-confidence in these 
                            important areas (Weinberg &#38; Gould, 1995). Such 
                            analysis will lead to a better understanding of how 
                            sport and physical activity can contribute to self-perceptions 
                            whether they be positive or negative. Finally, studies 
                            should also develop and implement intervention strategies 
                            aimed at raising females&#146; perceptions of their 
                            physical ability (Eccles &#38; Harold, 1991).

                            children know each other, further investigation is 
                            needed to establish which will specifically determine 
                            how girls best learn motor skills (Garcia, 1994), 
                            sport skills (Wiese-Bjornstal &#38; Weiss, 1992) and 
                            exercise skills (Marsh &#38; Peart, 1988). It is important 
                            to gather and critically analyze such data because 
                            girls&#146; learning styles may be different from 
                            the conventional approaches designed for boys.

                            is a particularly fruitful line of inquiry. For example,

                            drugs (e.g., steroids) must be examined in conjunction

                            may lead to the development of eating disorders and

                            whether adolescent athletes are more likely to have 
                            eating disorders than their nonathletic peers (Caldwell, 
                            1993), and to design appropriate intervention programs.

                            physical activity to include a broader range of activities 
                            (e.g., personal fitness) and settings (e.g., physical 
                            education classrooms). Additionally, studies should 
                            include participants from racially, ethnically, economically 
                            and ability-diverse backgrounds because gender interacts 
                            with these diversities in complex ways (Gill, 1993). 
                          <li class="graycopy">Utilize interdisciplinary research 
                            perspectives. Much of the previously cited literature 
                            employed a unidimensional approach where only one 
                            particular sport-related dimension was examined (e.g., 
                            the psychological impact of participation). Future 
                            research must adopt a biopsychosocial perspective 
                            which simultaneously takes into account physical, 
                            psychological and social context variables (Gill, 
                            1995). It is clear that contextual and maturational 
                            factors moderate the influence of socialization, physical 
                            ability and psychological factors on girls&#146; participation 
                            in physical activity (Weiss &#38; Glenn, 1992).

                          and their expressions of physicality. Gender is a key 
                          theme in physicality because most girls learn and reproduce 
                          &#147;appropriate&#148; female styles of movement (Young, 
                          1990). Therefore, an exploration of the social factors

                          to understand girls&#146; involvement in sport, exercise 
                          and physical activity. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> This review begins with a discussion 
                          of how children&#146;s gender is socially constructed 
                          at a very young age. The second part examines how adolescence 
                          can exaggerate gender differences and how, in order 
                          to avoid compromising their femininity, many girls drop 
                          out of sport and physical activity altogether. The third 
                          part outlines the problems associated with lack of involvement 
                          in physical activity. The fourth part describes the 
                          benefits that accrue to those who are physically active. 
                          The fifth part discusses the influence of Title IX, 
                          which has significantly increased physical activity 
                          opportunities for girls, and as a result, seems to have 
                          changed the attitudes of some parents, teachers and 
                          physical educators regarding the importance of sport 
                          and active leisure for girls. The sixth part suggests 
                          specific ways to enable young girls&#146; participation 
                          in physical activity, sport and leisure. The last section

                        <p class="graycopy"> The social construction of gender 
                          begins in early childhood perhaps as early as infancy, 
                          as children respond to cues from parents, teachers and 
                          others (Greendorfer, 1983). Children first identify 
                          notions of gender by focusing on a few obvious physical 
                          or external cues such as hairstyle, dress and name (Bailey, 
                          1993). By age two, clear sex differences in interests 
                          appear (Pitcher &#38; Schultz, 1983). By age three, 
                          children know many of the implicit social rules that 
                          guide feminine and masculine behavior. They may also 
                          start to believe that it is wrong for people to engage 
                          in cross-sex activities (Bailey, 1993; Ignico, 1990). 
                          Younger children (i.e., preschool to first or second 
                          grade) tend to adopt more stereotypical attitudes about 
                          gender than older children. Such early experiences often 
                          shape later behavior, although children may revise their 
                          ideas of femininity or masculinity in the light of new 
                          information and experiences (Bailey, 1993). For example, 
                          a girl who believes only boys should play football and 
                          climb trees may revise her belief when she witnesses 
                          her favorite female cousin doing both. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Creating a gendered self is crucial 
                          to a child&#146;s sense of social competence and psychological 
                          well-being (Davies, 1989, 1990; Pitcher &#38; Schultz, 
                          1983), and for this reason, children internalize gender 
                          categories and practice corresponding behaviors. Through 
                          their own active efforts to engage in what they perceive 
                          as gender-appropriate behaviors, children take on social 
                          roles and characteristics labeled as feminine or masculine; 
                          this in turn restricts girls&#146; opportunities and 
                          aspirations, unless they also receive cues from parents, 
                          teachers and others that are not limiting. 
                        <p> <span class="graycopy"><b>ESTABLISHING GENDER DIFFERENCE</b> 
                          </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> One of the first things that contemporary 
                          society teaches children about the process of becoming 
                          gendered is that it involves establishing differences 
                          between females and males (Birrell &#38; Cole, 1990; 
                          Duncan, 1990). These differences are not merely distinctions&#151;they 
                          are sometimes interpreted as direct opposites (Beauvoir, 
                          1952; Betterton, 1987; Connell, 1987; Kuhn, 1985; Orenstein, 
                          1994). In particular, the media, parents, teachers and 
                          peers tell children in many obvious and subtle ways 
                          that if boys are one thing, girls are its opposite (Duncan, 
                          Messner, Williams, &#38; Jensen, 1994; Kane &#38; Greendorfer, 
                          1994). Thus, a crucial component of social competence 
                          for many girls may depend on maintaining and defending 
                          that opposition. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The emphasis on gender opposition 
                          often shapes the ways in which children physically express 
                          themselves (Duncan &#38; Sayaovong, 1990). Girls learn 
                          &#147;a specific repertoire of gestures, postures and 
                          movements&#148; (Bartky, 1988, p. 64) that can be quite 
                          different from that of boys; early on, girls discover 
                          that stereotypic femininity requires delicate, restrained 
                          movements (e.g., crossing the legs, folding the arms) 
                          and limited use of space (Henley, 1977; Young, 1990). 
                          Activities such as sports that require more vigorous 
                          movements and greater use of space are often socially 
                          coded as masculine. Although children may engage in 
                          activities coded for the other sex, the social norms 
                          that have been established for each gender, and the 
                          sense of identity that these norms may foster, are a 
                          powerful influence. As Hasbrook (1995) noted in her 
                          ethnography of grade-school children, both girls and 
                          boys believe that &#147;girls are not supposed to be 
                          big, strong, powerful or physical; such attributes are 
                          [seen as] shameful and a source of offense to others, 
                          particularly boys&#148; (p. 17). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In early childhood, children strengthen 
                          their sense of gender identity by associating with others 
                          of the same skill level and sex while generally rejecting 
                          opposite-sex groups, an arrangement that typically reinforces 
                          the differences between girls&#146; and boys&#146; activities 
                          (Adler, Kless, &#38; Adler, 1992; Bailey, 1993; Pitcher 
                          &#38; Schultz, 1983). For example, girls often say that 
                          they prefer not to engage in boys&#146; games and play 
                          (Green, 1987). This preference should not be surprising 
                          given the way that boys treat girls who encroach on 
                          &#147;their&#148; territory. As Hasbrook (1995) notes, 
                          &#147;girls who display strength, power or physicality 
                          when interacting with boys run the risk of being disliked, 
                          chastised and/or marginalized&#148; (p. 17). The notion 
                          of gender difference and opposition can occur even in 
                          kindergarten. For example, in recreational sports such 
                          as tee ball aimed at five and six year-old girls and 
                          boys, coaches and peers have been found to clearly communicate 
                          the stereotypic attitude that girls do not belong in 
                          such &#147;male&#148; activities (Landers &#38; Fine, 
                          1996). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Some girls may shun sport altogether 
                          to avoid compromising their femininity, or they may 
                          prefer sports and physical activities that appear to 
                          be more gender-appropriate: cooperative, aesthetically 
                          pleasing, expressive, graceful activities such as cheerleading, 
                          gymnastics, diving, swimming, tennis, figure skating 
                          and dance (Duncan &#38; Hasbrook, 1988; Kane &#38; Snyder, 
                          1989; Metheny, 1965; Young, 1990). These activities 
                          contrast with those that are socially prescribed for 
                          boys: aggressive, competitive, territorial, strength-focused 
                          team sports that involve a great deal of body contact. 
                          Children as young as four have identified playing with 
                          dolls, picking flowers, dressing up, skipping and dancing 
                          as appropriate for girls, and activities such as football, 
                          baseball, basketball, soccer, hockey, karate and fighting 
                          as appropriate for boys (Bailey, 1993). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Regardless of the social prohibitions 
                          against girls&#146; participation in some forms of physical 
                          activity, a number of researchers argue that girls are 
                          not naturally less athletic than boys (Costa &#38; Guthrie, 
                          1994). While girls&#146; activities may be different 
                          (such as jumping rope, swinging on the bars, performing 
                          complicated dance routines), they still require agility, 
                          coordination, strength and attentional focus (Bailey, 
                          1993; Green, 1987; Hasbrook, 1995; Thorne, 1993). In 
                          fact, girls possess the physical capabilities to perform 
                          well in all kinds of movement activities. What they 
                          may lack is the social support to do so. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> More and more girls are daring to 
                          cross the &#147;gender divide&#148; and are insisting 
                          on their right to play baseball/softball, basketball, 
                          football and soccer despite the fact that they may be 
                          pejoratively labeled as &#147;tomboys,&#148; either 
                          by their parents and teachers, or by other boys and 
                          girls. This unfortunate tendency to label others was 
                          corroborated by Hasbrook&#146;s 1995 ethnographic study 
                          of a mostly African- American grade school in Milwaukee&#146;s 
                          inner city which suggested that certain cultures (i.e., 
                          African- American, Asian-American) may be less tolerant 
                          of girls who defy gender stereotypes than is white, 
                          middle-class society. Thorne&#146;s 1993 discussion 
                          of two working class schools with culturally diverse 
                          students revealed a similar intolerance for &#147;tomboys.&#148; 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Some girls may find the sport itself 
                          sufficiently rewarding to continue playing despite social 
                          disapproval (Nelson, 1991). Girls who manage to carve 
                          out a niche for themselves in boys&#146; games are far 
                          more likely to be committed sports participants later 
                          in life. In a research report surveying seven thousand 
                          female sports enthusiasts, one of the most interesting 
                          findings was that the most active sportswomen shared 
                          the childhood experience of playing mostly with boys 
                          or in mixed gender groups, rather than mostly with girls 
                          (&#147;Miller Lite Report on Women in Sports,&#148; 
                          1985). 
                        <p> <span class="graycopy"><b>ADOLESCENCE: THE COSTS OF 
                          GENDER DIFFERENCE</b> </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> A number of researchers have suggested 
                          that sharp declines in girls&#146; self-esteem, academic 
                          performance, athletic involvement and body-image during 
                          adolescence are perhaps &#147;heterosexualization&#148; 
                          and &#147;emphasized femininity&#148; (AAUW and the 
                          Wellesley College Center for Research on Women, 1992; 
                          Daley, 1991; Orenstein, 1994; Pipher, 1994; Simmons 
                          &#38; Blyth, 1987; Thorne, 1993). Pipher (1994) describes 
                          this adolescent fall as &#147;a social and developmental 
                          Bermuda Triangle&#148; in which girls &#147;lose their 
                          assertive, energetic and &#145;tomboyish&#146; personalities 
                          and become more deferential, self-critical and depressed. 
                          They report great unhappiness with their own bodies&#148; 
                          (p. 19). In short, the social status of adolescent girls 
                          often depends on conformity to the feminine stereotype 
                          and the intensification of gender difference. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Girls may perceive that it is socially 
                          unacceptable to be strong, physical and athletically 
                          talented; this is the very definition of a popular boy. 
                          An erroneous but particularly persistent and long-standing 
                          belief is that sports are masculinizing and that physically 
                          active girls are more likely to become lesbians, or 
                          that all successful female athletes are lesbians (Cahn, 
                          1994b; Kane, 1996; Lenskyj, 1986). Though this homophobic 
                          belief is unfounded, it leads some girls to avoid physical 
                          activity. It is also not surprising that as girls approach 
                          adolescence, many of them lose interest in vigorous 
                          physical activity and sport and may even stop participating 
                          altogether (&#147;The Wilson Report: Moms, Dads, Daughters 
                          and Sports,&#148; 1988). For girls and boys, the dramatic 
                          physical transformations that occur during puberty are 
                          accompanied by equally dramatic social changes. However, 
                          although both sexes grapple with new roles and restrictions, 
                          those that adolescent girls must face present different 
                          challenges. While skill at sport is a significant factor 
                          in determining social status for many boys, physical 
                          attractiveness and success with boys tend to determine 
                          social status for girls (Adler et al., 1992; Thorne, 
                          1993). This means that girls are placed in the very 
                          difficult position of being valued not for what they 
                          achieve but for how they look. Indeed, being pretty 
                          and being skilled at courtship rituals may take primacy 
                          over getting good grades, joining athletic teams or 
                          engaging in regular physical activity. The media (e.g., 
                          rock videos, television, teenage magazines, romance 
                          novels) are particularly powerful influences at this 
                          age (Adler et al., 1992; Bailey, 1993; Duncan, 1994; 
                          Thorne, 1993). The popular media tend to sexualize, 
                          romanticize and objectify young women. Many girls start 
                          to regard themselves in these ways and are indeed treated 
                          as such by others (Adler et al., 1992; Pipher, 1994). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In spite of the findings mentioned 
                          above, there is growing evidence that cultural differences 
                          may temper mainstream expectations for girls&#146; appearance 
                          and activities. For example, the &#147;Women&#146;s 
                          Sports Foundation Report: Minorities in Sport&#148; 
                          (1989) found that Hispanic, Caucasian and African-American 
                          high-school females who engaged in athletics perceived 
                          themselves as more popular than did their nonathletic 
                          counterparts in those same categories. Findings from 
                          this report also revealed that 87 percent of the mothers 
                          and fathers sampled &#147;accept the idea that sports 
                          are equally important for boys and girls&#148; (p. 1). 
                          This is an important area of research that needs further 
                          development.

                          SPECIAL RISK</b> </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Some subgroups of girls face particularly 
                          daunting obstacles to participating in sport and physical 
                          activity. For example, some subcultures or minority 
                          groups are less tolerant of behavior that defies gender 
                          stereotypes such as &#147;tomboyism&#148; (Hasbrook, 
                          1995). A retrospective study of working women found 
                          that girls of color were less likely than Caucasian 
                          girls to participate in intramural sports (&#147;Miller 
                          Lite Report on Sports &#38; Fitness in the Lives of 
                          Working Women,&#148; 1993). While 31 percent of Caucasian 
                          girls played intramural sports, only 19 percent of minority 
                          girls did so. These differences may be compounded by 
                          differences in socioeconomic status and geographical 
                          location (i.e., urban versus rural areas). Furthermore, 
                          girls of color were significantly less likely than Caucasian 
                          girls to receive encouragement from their parents to 
                          engage in athletic and fitness activities (11 percent 
                          versus 16 percent). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> These findings were partly corroborated 
                          by another study that revealed that African-American 
                          girls were more likely to have parents who believed 
                          sports were more important for boys than for girls; 
                          that African-American girls were more likely to feel 
                          &#147;boys make fun of girls who play sports&#148;; 
                          and that African-American girls had fewer financial 
                          resources for lessons, equipment and transportation 
                          to games (&#147;The Wilson Report: Moms, Dads, Daughters 
                          and Sports,&#148; 1988). Finally, according to the recently 
                          released Surgeon General&#146;s report on physical activity 
                          and health (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 
                          1996)&#151;which offers 1992 National Health Interview 
                          Survey data from the Youth Risk Behavior supplement&#151;white, 
                          non-Hispanic females had higher levels of vigorous physical 
                          activity (49%) than black, non-Hispanic (42.3%) or Hispanic 
                          females (41.7%); males had statistically similar levels 
                          regardless of race/ethnicity status (60.2%, 62.7% and 
                          56.7%, respectively).

                          PHYSICAL ACTIVITY</b> </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Unfortunately, rejecting involvement 
                          in sport and physical activity due to socialized stereotypes 
                          has its costs. (See also Section II: Psychological Dimensions.) 
                          The most obvious drawbacks are the health costs, both 
                          physical health (see also Section I: Physiological Dimensions) 
                          and mental health (see also Section IV: Mental Health 
                          Dimensions). Without regular exercise, girls and women 
                          tend to tire easily, have less energy (Rowland, 1990), 
                          and be more susceptible to infection and disease (Calabrese, 
                          1990; Kramer &#38; Wells, 1996). On the credit side, 
                          regular exercise makes young girls and women have more 
                          energy, feel better and cope more effectively with stress 
                          (Lutter &#38; Jaffee, 1990). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Children who are physically unskilled 
                          may frequently be excluded from group activities and 
                          games (Ignico, 1990). Failure to develop a range of 
                          fundamental motor skills (a &#147;movement vocabulary&#148; 
                          [Bennett et al., 1987]) at a young age makes it more 
                          difficult to take up physical activities and sport later 
                          in life. Adolescents and adults lacking &#147;movement 
                          literacy&#148; (e.g., competence) find it doubly hard 
                          to learn new ways of moving their bodies, both because 
                          of the unaccustomed physical demands and because of 
                          the fear of appearing awkward and unskilled. Even if 
                          women wish to begin regular fitness activities for the 
                          first time in adulthood, fear of embarrassment may deter 
                          them (Nelson, 1991). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Another potential consequence of 
                          not participating in sport and physical activity is 
                          related to the development of one&#146;s character. 
                          Although conventional wisdom would have us believe that 
                          &#147;sport builds character,&#148; research on character 
                          development in youths who participate in sport is equivocal. 
                          Some research findings suggest that sport involvement 
                          does not necessarily build character (Miracle &#38; 
                          Rees, 1994; see also Section II: Psychological Dimensions). 
                          However, Fejgin&#146;s 1994 study found a weak, but 
                          significant, correlation between participation in competitive 
                          high-school sports and higher grades, higher self-concept, 
                          higher educational aspirations and fewer discipline 
                          problems. Despite these contradictory findings, there 
                          are certain unequivocal personal benefits (e.g., a sense 
                          of personal accomplishment, the development of social 
                          networks, the pleasure of movement) from participation 
                          in physical activities (Whitson, 1994). 
                        <p> <span class="graycopy"><b>BENEFITS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY</b> 
                          </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Sporting skills can lead to the development 
                          of important social skills. People form new acquaintances, 
                          consolidate old friendships and learn how to cooperate 
                          and negotiate on the tennis court, golf course or softball 
                          diamond. Successful sport experiences can also build 
                          confidence, self-esteem and positive body- image (Jaffee 
                          &#38; Manzer, 1992; &#147;Miller Lite Report on Women 
                          in Sports,&#148; 1985), personal qualities that adolescents 
                          especially need (see also Section II: Psychological 
                          Dimensions). Participation in physical activity has 
                          also been linked to a lower incidence of depression 
                          (National Council for Research on Women, 1995) (see 
                          also Section IV: Mental Health Dimensions). Moreover, 
                          being physically strong is a practical benefit in many 
                          day-to-day undertakings: carrying grocery bags or suitcases, 
                          moving furniture, digging a garden, mowing the lawn. 
                          Those who view their bodies as useful and powerful are 
                          less likely to abuse their bodies. This is of particular 
                          importance since a number of contemporary disorders 
                          such as anorexia, bulimia and chemical abuse begin in 
                          adolescence (Chernin, 1981) (see also Section II: Psychological 
                          Dimensions). At all ages, involvement in sport and fitness 
                          activities is pleasurable and satisfying in and of itself 
                          (Pellett &#38; Harrison, 1992). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The association between physical 
                          activity and other &#147;performance domains&#148; seems 
                          especially critical for minority students when it comes 
                          to the educational and academic benefits of involvement 
                          in varsity sports. For example, based on a nationwide 
                          probability sample of thirty thousand high-school students, 
                          a study conducted in the late 1980s revealed that Caucasian 
                          female athletes had lower school dropout rates than 
                          Caucasian female nonathletes in suburban and rural schools 
                          (&#147;Women&#146;s Sports Foundation Report: Minorities 
                          in Sport,&#148; 1989). This study also indicated that 
                          Caucasian female athletes tended to do better in high 
                          school and college, feel more popular, be more involved 
                          in extracurricular activities and be more likely to 
                          aspire to community leadership than did Caucasian female 
                          nonathletes. In addition, Hispanic female athletes had 
                          a significantly lower dropout rate than did Hispanic 
                          female nonathletes&#151;one-third lower. Furthermore, 
                          Hispanic female athletes were much more likely than 
                          their nonathletic counterparts to attend and stay in 
                          college. In relation to social involvement (e.g., participation 
                          in non-sport activities such as school newspaper and 
                          Girl Scouts), minority athletes of both sexes were more 
                          socially involved than nonathletes, and African-American 
                          and Hispanic athletes of both sexes scored higher on 
                          standardized tests. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In a study conducted during this 
                          same time period, Melnick, Vanfossen and Sabo (1988) 
                          found that athletic participation was strongly related 
                          to extracurricular involvement and modestly related 
                          to perceived popularity for high-school girls. However, 
                          these relationships are quite complex and may involve 
                          interactions with socioeconomic status, subcultures 
                          and specific sport experiences. For example, an intriguing 
                          analysis of longitudinal survey data by Hanson and Kraus 
                          (1996) found a relationship between girls&#146; involvement 
                          in high-school sports and achievement in science (e.g., 
                          GPA, standardized scores). For Caucasian girls, participation 
                          in sports was positively associated with attitudes toward 
                          science (i.e., perceived relevance of math for one&#146;s 
                          future occupation) and access to science (i.e., course- 
                          taking). However, for African-American girls, participation 
                          in sports was found to negatively influence their achievement 
                          in and access to science classes. In contrast, sports 
                          participation had no effect on the science experiences 
                          of Hispanic girls. These findings must be regarded with 
                          caution, however, since the data were first collected 
                          in 1980. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> What seems clear from the preceding 
                          information is that females experience many benefits 
                          from their involvement in sport and physical activity. 
                          At the same time, some researchers have argued that 
                          females may have special contributions to make to physical 
                          activity and sport. For example, many of the young women 
                          who responded to the &#147;Miller Lite Report on Women 
                          in Sports&#148; of 1985 felt they could teach men something 
                          about humane competition. In addition, research on children&#146;s 
                          play styles suggests that girls put a high value on 
                          positive social interaction and self-expression, important 
                          antidotes to the competitive excesses of contemporary 
                          sport (Evans, 1986; Gilligan, 1982; Lenskyj, 1994; cf. 
                          Nelson, 1991). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In short, it is clear that girls 
                          can either gain or lose out on important benefits related 
                          to sport and physical activity. (And although the focus 
                          of this report is on girls, it is important to note 
                          that the same is also true for boys). While many barriers 
                          still exist, fortunately, attitudes and behaviors towards 
                          girls&#146; involvement are changing. One significant 
                          instance of such social change was the passage of Title 
                          IX legislation. The following section outlines the impact 
                          of Title IX and suggests how people in key social roles 
                          such as teachers, parents and coaches can support girls&#146; 
                          sport participation, and in so doing, can also transform 
                          our sporting institutions.

                          receiving federal funds through the passage of Title 
                          IX. Combined with the advocacy efforts of the women&#146;s 
                          sports movement, this legislation had a significant 
                          impact by expanding physical activity opportunities 
                          for girls and women (&#147;Miller Lite Report on Sports 
                          &#38; Fitness in the Lives of Working Women,&#148; 1993) 
                          and changing attitudes about the appropriateness of 
                          sports for females (Durant, 1992). During the decade 
                          and a half that followed the passage of Title IX, the 
                          number of girls participating in high school sports 
                          rose from 294,015 in 1971 to 1,836,356 in 1986&#150;1987 
                          (Sage, 1990), and a 1993 survey showed that 37 percent 
                          of high-school athletes were female (&#147;Miller Lite 
                          Report on Sports &#38; Fitness in the Lives of Working 
                          Women,&#148; 1993). Another study (&#147;Women&#146;s 
                          Sports Foundation Report: Minorities in Sport,&#148; 
                          1989) reported that 30.5 percent of high-school girls 
                          took part in interscholastic sports in 1990&#150;1991, 
                          compared to less than one percent of high-school girls 
                          who participated in such sports in 1971, before the 
                          enactment of Title IX. These figures not only reflect 
                          an unprecedented increase, but also demonstrate that 
                          when girls&#146; sporting involvement is vigorously 
                          supported by social institutions, they participate in 
                          record numbers. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> It is important to point out, however, 
                          that Title IX has had an uneven history of enforcement 
                          and advances in equity. During leaner times, when educational 
                          funding has been decreased, fewer gains in equity and 
                          some backsliding have occurred (Blum, 1993; Fox, 1992). 
                          For example, from 1980 to 1988, federal enforcement 
                          of Title IX was slowed to a standstill. In 1988, the 
                          passage of the Civil Rights Restoration Act infused 
                          new life into equity efforts (Blum, 1993). Although 
                          many inequities have been identified and corrected, 
                          there are many more cases of discrimination that must 
                          be countered (Durant, 1992; Fox, 1992). As one analyst 
                          summarized, &#147;The face of sex discrimination in 
                          athletics has changed. It was often no longer the purposeful 
                          exclusion of the past, but a collection of more subtle 
                          inequities that could be explained away by a lack of 
                          resources&#148; (Fox, 1992, p. 50). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Unfortunately, institutions have 
                          attempted to reverse the Title IX gains made by girls 
                          and women in sport programs. For example, financially 
                          strapped school administrators and coaches have argued 
                          against equivalent sport provisions (National Women&#146;s 
                          Law Center, 1995). In addition, organizations such as 
                          the Women&#146;s Sports Foundation and the National 
                          Association for Girls and Women in Sport have offered 
                          assistance in the interpretation and implementation 
                          of Title IX. A Title IX Coalition was formed to disseminate 
                          information about Title IX to parents, athletes and 
                          administrators, and as a result of these efforts, it 
                          appears that some high schools and colleges are actively 
                          complying (D. Larkin, personal communication, May 1995). 
                          It seems clear that the future of girls&#146; sporting 
                          participation depends in part upon continually monitoring 
                          progress toward compliance and vigorously working to 
                          educate the public.

                          </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Because involvement in physical activity 
                          and sport is so beneficial for females of all ages, 
                          it is important to ensure that girls are given sufficient 
                          opportunities to develop their physical skills. How 
                          are girls to fully capitalize on the potential benefits 
                          of physical activity and sport? Much of the research 
                          previously cited offers specific recommendations for 
                          fostering and increasing girls&#146; participation in 
                          physical activity, leisure and sport. Some specific 
                          guidelines for teachers, parents, physical educators, 
                          coaches and others who work with children follow. <br>
                        <ul>
                          <li class="graycopy">It is essential to eliminate gender-typing 
                            whenever possible. Activities should never be labeled 
                            as &#147;girls&#146; games&#148; or &#147;boys&#146; 
                            games,&#148; &#147;feminine&#148; or &#147;masculine&#148; 
                            (Ignico, 1990; Pellett &#38; Harrison, 1992; Thorne, 
                            1993). When children come to school with preconceptions 
                            about &#147;girls&#146; games&#148; and &#147;boys&#146; 
                            games,&#148; teachers may wish to introduce new activities 
                            that aren&#146;t already gender- typed (e.g., hackey-sack, 
                            croquet, New Games). 
                          <li class="graycopy">Leaders should avoid using sex 
                            as a basis for forming physical activity groups (Thorne, 
                            1993). If children need to be grouped, use criteria 
                            that are gender-neutral (e.g., kids with brothers 
                            versus kids with sisters; kids who like dogs versus 
                            kids who like cats). Girls and boys need to work and 
                            play together, starting from an early age. Arbitrarily 
                            segregating girls and boys may create hostility and 
                            perpetuate power imbalances (Goodenough, 1987), and 
                            although there has been a great deal of recent interest 
                            in gender-segregated schools (see Sadker &#38; Sadker, 
                            1994), there is as yet no direct evidence that gender-segregated 
                            physical activity is desirable. The important consideration 
                            is to be sure that all children have adequate preparation. 
                            It is easiest for both sexes to play together and 
                            learn in small, non-competitive groups where children 
                            know each other well and have the prerequisite skills 
                            (Goodenough, 1987; Thorne, 1993). 
                          <li class="graycopy">Professionals must actively intervene 
                            in the face of discrimination. When adults observe 
                            inequities or gender stereotyping on the playing field 
                            or in the classroom, it is often best to openly confront 
                            issues of sexism, prejudice or discrimination (Thorne, 
                            1993). Encourage children to develop critical thinking 
                            about gender-based biases. 
                          <li class="graycopy">Coaches and physical educators 
                            should give girls equal access and attention. Both 
                            girls and boys should play the important and interesting 
                            positions in a game (e.g., pitcher, goalie, forward). 
                            In addition, both should receive feedback to help 
                            improve their skills. 
                          <li class="graycopy">All of us must challenge stereotypes 
                            whenever possible. When teachers choose games and 
                            lead activities, a female teacher might play football, 
                            a male teacher might jump rope (Thorne, 1993). 
                          <li class="graycopy">Physical educators, exercise leaders 
                            and coaches should develop and implement new models 
                            of sport and physical activity. For example, professionals 
                            can emphasize learning new skills, having fun, cooperating 
                            and making friends (Lenskyj, 1994). Although competitive 
                            skills and attitudes may be valuable preparation for 
                            today&#146;s working world (D. Sabo, personal communication, 
                            1996), competition should not be allowed to displace 
                            other sports values and experiences. 
                          <li class="graycopy">Parents, coaches and physical activity 
                            leaders should avoid the use of gender-typed language. 
                            For instance, do not refer to athletes as &#147;he&#148; 
                            or use the generic male to mean both males and females. 
                            It may be helpful to tell children stories that allow 
                            them to imagine situations where traditional gender 
                            roles are reversed (Davies, 1989). At a very young 
                            age, children may seem resistant to change (Bailey, 
                            1993), but adults can provide them with nonsexist 
                            information which they will rely on as they mature. 
                            (Pitcher &#38; Schultz, 1983). Children who are in 
                            fifth and sixth grade may be ready to apply some critical 
                            thinking skills and challenge gender stereotyping.

                        <p class="graycopy"> As our research agendas are developed 
                          and implemented, we must remember that providing girls 
                          with sufficient participation opportunities depends 
                          on rejecting stereotypic definitions of femininity and 
                          masculinity. As Davies succinctly puts it, to move beyond 
                          male-female dualism, &#147;all we have to do is stop 
                          doing the work that maintains the difference&#148; (1989, 
                          p. 136). The following are some priority areas for future 
                          research related to the sociological dimensions of girls&#146; 
                          participation in physical activity and sport. <br>

                            the lifespan. The findings of this review suggest 
                            that involvement in physical activity from early childhood 
                            through girlhood to womanhood needs more in-depth 
                            investigation. Such research should encompass fundamental 
                            fitness activities and spontaneous, informal play

                            class, religion or sexual orientation intersect with

                            in sport and physical activity. For example, only 
                            a handful of studies have examined how race affects 
                            girls&#146; sport and fitness involvement, and even 
                            these studies have limitations&#151;such investigations 
                            have failed to differentiate between African-Americans 
                            and the various ethnic/racial groups that comprise 
                            Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and American

                            development and implementation. For example, how can

                            for involvement in fitness, sport and play activities? 
                            How can we respect the needs of girls and women to 
                            feel competent using their bodies in a variety of 
                            settings? Our research should be guided by the principle 
                            that strategies for improving participation rates 
                            must also address the <i>quality</i> of the experience.

                          self-evaluation, peer standing and relationships with 
                          family and friends have a powerful influence on mental 
                          health and psychological well-being. Even though this 
                          time period is marked by transition, adaptation and 
                          stressful events, the majority of our youth traverse 
                          the landscape of adolescence successfully. However, 
                          failure to find adequate coping strategies can lead 
                          to emotional distress, anxiety disorders and clinical 
                          depression for some children and adolescents. Especially 
                          impacted are adolescent females who have been found 
                          to have higher rates of anxiety and depressive disorders 
                          than their male counterparts (Glied &#38; Kofman, 1995; 
                          Lewisohn, Hops, Roberts, Seeley, &#38; Andrews, 1993; 
                          McGrath, Keita, Strickland, &#38; Russo, 1990; Nolen-Hoeksema 
                          &#38; Girgus, 1994). &#147;Adolescent girls are saplings 
                          in a hurricane. They are young and vulnerable trees 
                          that the winds blow with gale strength&#148; (Pipher, 
                          1994, p. 22). Although most girls &#147;weather the 
                          storm of adolescence,&#148; it is important that opportunities 
                          to acquire the needed skills are provided for those 
                          who cannot. Young girls can learn to be strong, resilient 
                          and powerful, particularly as a result of physical activity 
                          and sport experiences. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> This section of the report offers 
                          both empirical and anecdotal evidence that supports 
                          increasing the use of exercise and sport as promising 
                          alternative psychological health interventions. In contrast 
                          to the broad approach of Section II: Psychological Dimensions, 
                          this section focuses specifically on mental health, 
                          especially its maintenance among at-risk adolescent 
                          girls. The first part reviews empirical support for 
                          the positive relationships among exercise, fitness and 
                          mental health, particularly focusing on the effect of 
                          exercise on anxiety and depression, two disorders prevalent 
                          among adolescent females. The second part presents both 
                          empirical and anecdotal evidence concerning female adolescent 
                          mental health and the use of exercise and sport as an 
                          ameliorative influence. The third part highlights some 
                          conclusions and recommendations as well as identifies 
                          significant areas of needed research.

                        <p class="graycopy"> Research has provided significant 
                          findings related to physical activity in two distinct 
                          areas of interest for mental health professionals: the 
                          use of sport and exercise to enhance psychological well-being, 
                          and its use to reduce problematic levels of anxiety 
                          and depression among individuals with mental health 
                          problems (Surgeon General&#146;s Report on Physical 
                          Activity and Health, USDHHS, 1996). A summary of this 
                          information is presented in three areas: 1) exercise 
                          and the enhancement of psychological well- being; 2) 
                          exercise and the reduction of problematic levels of 
                          anxiety and depression; and 3) hypotheses advanced by 
                          scholars and educators to explain the psychological 
                          benefits of exercise and sport.

                        <p class="graycopy"> In general, research has demonstrated 
                          that engaging in exercise and physical activity significantly 
                          enhances mental health. Participating in an exercise 
                          program has a positive impact on elevating mood and 
                          improving self-concept and self-esteem (Brandon &#38; 
                          Loftin, 1991; Jackson &#38; Marsh, 1986; King, Taylor, 
                          Haskell, &#38; DeBusk, 1989; MacMahon, 1990; Mutrie 
                          &#38; Biddle, 1995). Plante and Rodin (1990) and Plante 
                          (1993) determined from extensive meta-analyses that 
                          exercise has a positive impact on enhancing mood, self-concept 
                          and self-esteem. In addition, feelings of depression, 
                          anger and anxiety tend to dissipate after exercise (Smyth, 
                          1991). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Optimism is crucial to psychological 
                          well-being and has been shown to be influential in achievement 
                          behavior, self-mastery and enhanced motivation. A recent 
                          investigation by Kavussanu and McAuley (1995) demonstrated 
                          the relationship between high physical activity and 
                          optimism. Their findings also revealed an &#147;inverse 
                          relationship between regular exercise and trait anxiety 
                          levels&#148; (p. 254), suggesting that those who exercise 
                          have lower anxiety. In an earlier study, Buffone (1984) 
                          discussed the potential of exercise as a psychological 
                          enhancer and stated that &#147;current research in counseling, 
                          psychology and medicine points to physical exercise&#146;s 
                          positive effect on mental health. Running and other 
                          forms of exercise or sport participation, seem to build 
                          confidence, alleviate moderate anxiety and reactive 
                          depression, increase body awareness and image, reduce 
                          weight, promote habit control and improve sleep&#148; 
                          (p. 222). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The potential benefits of physical 
                          activity participation such as &#147;self-concept, self-esteem 
                          and body concept&#148; are especially important for 
                          the emotional well-being of women (Berger, 1984b, p. 
                          172). Jackson and Marsh (1986) concur with this finding 
                          stating that the emotional benefits of exercise participation 
                          are especially important to women, particularly the 
                          significant improvements in self- concept found in athletic 
                          women. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Recent studies have indicated that 
                          involvement in exercise, rather than actual fitness 
                          levels, may be the key to enhancing mental health. For 
                          example, in a study investigating the positive influence 
                          of physical activity on psychological well-being&#151;particularly 
                          as it relates to the ability to cope with stressful 
                          situations&#151;Long (1993) suggested that exercise 
                          can be used to function as a coping mechanism for stress, 
                          to regulate emotions and mediate stress reactions. This 
                          same author advocated physical activity that involved 
                          large muscle groups, such as jogging, swimming and cycling. 
                          Similarly, Thirlaway and Benton (1992) determined that 
                          it is participation in physical activity, rather than 
                          actual physical fitness, that has greater impact on 
                          improving mental health. Finally, Biddle (1995) suggested 
                          that there may be no empirical basis to support the 
                          necessity of rigorous exercise regimes in order to impact 
                          feelings of well-being. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In a comprehensive review of the 
                          research findings, Singer (1992) found that there are 
                          many psychological rewards of physical activity. Some 
                          of these are improved self-image, increased self- confidence, 
                          positive changes in mood, relief of tension, relief 
                          of premenstrual tension, increased alertness, increased 
                          energy and increased ability to cope.

                        <p class="graycopy"> It is estimated that as much as 25 
                          percent of the population suffer from anxiety and depressive 
                          disorders which may range in severity from mild to more 
                          severe forms (Singer, 1992). Such mental health states 
                          have been shown to be particularly responsive to exercise 
                          and/or physical activity that can decrease many of the 
                          symptoms associated with a number of psychiatric conditions 
                          (Plante, 1993; Surgeon General&#146;s Report on Physical 
                          Activity and Health, USDHHS, 1996). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> There are specific criteria for the 
                          diagnosis of acute depression including nine symptoms 
                          of depression: (a) depressed mood, (b) diminished interest 
                          or pleasure in most activities, (c) significant weight 
                          loss or weight gain that is unintentional or a daily 
                          decrease or increase in appetite, (d) insomnia or hypersomnia, 
                          (e) psychomotor agitation or retardation, (f) fatigue 
                          or loss of energy, (g) feelings of worthlessness or 
                          excessive or inappropriate guilt, (h) diminished ability 
                          to think or concentrate or indecisiveness, and (i) recurrent 
                          thoughts of death or suicide attempts (American Psychiatric 
                          Association, 1994). The criteria for a major depressive 
                          episode is having five or more of these symptoms present 
                          for a two-week period. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> A position paper from the International 
                          Society of Sport Psychology (ISSP) states that there 
                          is clinical evidence that exercise can have a beneficial 
                          effect on some psychiatric disorders. &#147;Physical 
                          activity can be a promising aid&#148; for people suffering 
                          from symptoms of depression (Singer, 1992, p. 199). 
                          Further, the majority of studies show that both aerobic 
                          and nonaerobic exercise can have an antidepressive effect 
                          with those patients experiencing mild to moderate depression 
                          (Martinsen, 1995; Plante, 1993). However, most published 
                          studies have been concerned with directly impacting 
                          the symptoms of depression with no differentiation made 
                          between the levels of depression of participants and 
                          with few studies specifying the degree to which clinically 
                          diagnosed participants were utilized (Martinsen, 1995; 
                          North, McCullagh, &#38; Tran, 1990). This section focuses 
                          on persons who have moderate rather than severe mental 
                          health problems (e.g., mild versus severe depression). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In two studies, Greist (1987) found 
                          exercise to be effective with clinically depressed outpatients 
                          in reducing moderate depression. In addition, exercise 
                          was shown to be as effective as group psychotherapy: 
                          those who continued to exercise maintained their improvements, 
                          while those who only participated in group therapy failed 
                          to maintain some of their improvements. Greist and Jefferson 
                          (1992) found that a combination of walking and running 
                          on a regular basis was highly effective in reducing 
                          mild to moderate depression. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> North, McCullagh and Tran (1990) 
                          conducted a meta-analysis of studies that ranged from 
                          a general population of individuals with depressive 
                          symptoms to clinically depressed participants. The authors 
                          concluded that both acute and chronic exercise in either 
                          aerobic or anaerobic forms significantly decreased unipolar 
                          depression. The largest decreases in depression levels 
                          were in participants under medical and psychological 
                          care. Exercise therapy (both aerobic and anaerobic) 
                          was a better antidepressant than relaxation and other 
                          &#147;enjoyable&#148; activities, and &#147;exercise 
                          was as effective in decreasing depression as was psychotherapy&#148; 
                          (p. 404). Exercise in combination with psychotherapy 
                          was a better intervention than exercise alone. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Similarly, other extensive reviews 
                          of the relevant research on exercise intervention with 
                          clinically depressed patients suggest that both aerobic 
                          and nonaerobic exercise are as beneficial as psychotherapy 
                          in reducing depression (Martinsen, 1994; Martinsen &#38; 
                          Stephens, 1994). These studies were with inpatient and 
                          outpatient populations with mild to moderate unipolar 
                          depression; no sound empirical studies were found which 
                          addressed the value of exercise intervention in bipolar, 
                          psychotic or melancholic disorders. It was also noted 
                          that no study has compared exercise and medication in

                          has antidepressant properties with both clinical and

                          genders and using all modes of exercise. The findings 
                          confirmed that exercise was as effective as psychotherapy 
                          in reducing depression and that exercise combined with 
                          psychotherapy yielded increased effectiveness. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In several meta-analyses and single 
                          studies, researchers have reported positive sport- and 
                          exercise-related effects on anxiety or on the joint 
                          examination of anxiety and depression. For example, 
                          Long and van Stavel (1995) reviewed 40 studies on the 
                          effects of exercise on reducing anxiety. The findings 
                          supported the view that &#147;exercise training is an 
                          effective means of anxiety reduction&#148; (p. 181). 
                          The authors also stated that the most important finding 
                          was that exercise was especially effective for those 
                          people with elevated levels of stress. Brown (1987) 
                          reported successfully using a prescription of exercise 
                          as a therapeutic intervention with anxious and depressed 
                          outpatients for many years and found this therapy to 
                          be effective and powerful for reducing anxiety and depression 
                          levels. Similarly, through a comprehensive analysis 
                          of the relevant literature since 1980 on nonclinical 
                          populations, Plante and Rodin (1990) found that exercise 
                          has been consistently shown to decrease mild to moderate 
                          anxiety, depressive symptoms and stress. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Plante (1993) conducted another meta-analysis 
                          of the research evidence regarding the use of aerobic 
                          exercise as a preventative and treatment intervention 
                          for more serious psychopathology. He found that this 
                          intervention was used most commonly with depressive 
                          and anxiety disorders. &#147;Exercise was found in many 
                          studies to be an effective adjunct treatment with panic 
                          disorder and other anxiety- disorder patients&#148; 
                          (p. 366). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Russoniello (1991, 1992) studied 
                          the effects of exercise therapy on both physiological 
                          and psychological variables associated with mood and 
                          stress among alcoholic patients in a rehabilitation 
                          center setting. He found significant positive results 
                          including decreases in sympathetic arousal (cortisol 
                          levels) and increased positive mood states (POMS) following 
                          the use of controlled exercise regimens. While these 
                          clinically-oriented studies have usually employed an 
                          aerobic program of walk/jog/run for exercise, other 
                          literature has demonstrated that both aerobic and nonaerobic 
                          exercise programs are effective in reducing depression 
                          and anxiety and increasing self-concept (Holloway, Beuter,

                        <p class="graycopy"> It has been well documented that 
                          exercise positively impacts psychological well-being 
                          and functions as an antidepressant (Johnsgard, 1989; 
                          MacMahon, 1990; Martinsen &#38; Stephens, 1994; North 
                          et al., 1990; Oler et al., 1994; Plante &#38; Rodin, 
                          1990). However, there is no clear theory concerning 
                          underlying mechanisms to account for these effects. 
                          Several hypotheses have been offered to explain how 
                          exercise functions to reduce symptoms of depression, 
                          though none has been consistently sustained in empirical 
                          studies. It is possible that the beneficial consequences 
                          of exercise and physical activity may be mediated by 
                          a physiological, chemical or psychosocial component. 
                          According to Johnsgard, &#147;It may turn out to be 
                          the case that all of these hypotheses will be shown 
                          to play a legitimate role in explaining the antidepressant 
                          effects of exercise&#148; (1989, p. 146).

                        <p class="graycopy"> Numerous biological and chemical 
                          hypotheses have been proposed to explain the effects 
                          of exercise on positive psychological health. One theory 
                          implies that exercise increases levels of brain norepinephrine 
                          and serotonin levels and that the release of endogenous 
                          opiods from the pituitary gland act as a mood enhancer 
                          and antidepressant. Another hypothesis is the thermogenic 
                          theory which suggests that increases in body temperature 
                          have a tranquilizing effect (Greist &#38; Jefferson, 
                          1992; Page &#38; Tucker, 1994; Plante, 1993; Sime, 1987; 
                          Tuson &#38; Sinyor, 1993). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> According to Greist and Jefferson, 
                          &#147;some experts believe that simply moving large 
                          muscle masses in regular rhythmical ways is inconsistent 
                          with depression&#148; (1992). North et al. (1990) endorse 
                          a psychobiological theory to explain the antidepressant 
                          effect of exercise. They suggest that there are both 
                          biochemical and psychological changes resulting from 
                          exercise that influence depression.

                          </span> 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Several psychosocial hypotheses have 
                          been presented concerning the connection between exercise 
                          and improved perceptions of well-being. Exercise and 
                          physical activity can furnish a sense of achievement, 
                          promote feelings of personal control, provide a channel 
                          for emotional release and reconnect one to the play 
                          of childhood (Baumel, 1995). The positive feelings derived 
                          from exercise and physical activity may also be due 
                          to feelings of mastery, self-efficacy and accomplishment 
                          of a task (Bandura, 1990). Involvement in physical activity 
                          has also been suggested to provide a sense of competence, 
                          an emotional catharsis and a form of biofeedback, which 
                          teaches participants how to regulate their emotions 
                          (Brown &#38; Siegel, 1988; Fox, 1988; Kavussanu &#38;

                        <p class="graycopy"> Other psychosocial mechanisms that 
                          have been suggested include the possibility that physical 
                          activity provides a distraction from problems, and that 
                          exercise can offer a change of scenery and divert one&#146;s 
                          mind from anxious thoughts (Baumel, 1995; Long, 1993; 
                          Martinsen &#38; Stephens, 1994; Norris, Carroll, &#38;

                          Benton, 1992). King et al. (1989) found that among their 
                          participants, awareness of secondary physical changes 
                          (e.g., weight loss) was responsible for some of the 
                          psychological benefits associated with exercise. For 
                          depressed females, it may be a combination of the physical 
                          benefits (e.g., increased endurance, reduced fatigue, 
                          improved appearance and strength) and the psychological 
                          benefits (e.g., increased competence and success, becoming 
                          better organized, loss of passivity and helplessness) 
                          that works to alleviate depression (Berger, 1984a). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Social interactions have been suggested 
                          as mediators to the perceptions of improved well-being 
                          associated with sport and exercise. Social relationships 
                          (e.g., coach/athlete) that function in place of or in 
                          addition to parental relationships, as well as peer 
                          support, have also emerged as significant factors in 
                          a few studies (Oler et al., 1994; Page &#38; Tucker,

                        <p class="graycopy"> This section focuses on three themes 
                          found in the literature. The first theme concerns the 
                          mental health problems of girls, especially during their 
                          adolescence. An alarming feature of this review is the 
                          prevalence of depression as well as the growing awareness 
                          of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms among 
                          some adolescent girls. The second theme concerns the 
                          empirical and anecdotal material on programs using exercise 
                          as an intervention for adolescent girls. The third theme 
                          focuses on sport and exercise as preventative measures 
                          in the mental health treatment of adolescent females. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> The research literature on female 
                          mental health is sparse (McGrath et al., 1990; Mufson, 
                          Moreau, Weissman, &#38; Klerman, 1993). Some prevalent 
                          psychological disorders that affect adolescent girls 
                          (and boys) are depression, anxiety disorders and suicidal 
                          ideation (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990). Adolescent female depression, 
                          with its many co-occurring manifestations, is of great 
                          concern both to professionals and to loved ones. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Research on adolescent depression, 
                          consistent with other depression research, has focused 
                          on three constructs: depressed mood, chronic syndromes 
                          and acute disorder. All share a common set of symptoms. 
                          The duration and severity of the symptoms are critical 
                          factors in determining the level of depression (Compas, 
                          Ey, &#38; Grant, 1993). Furthermore, a noted author 
                          addressing depression among females has criticized the 
                          trivialization of reported symptoms of depression which 
                          fail to meet the criteria for acute depression when 
                          &#147;the line between subclinical and clinical levels 
                          of depression is blurry at best&#148; (Nolen-Hoeksema, 
                          1990, p. 5).

                          Mental Health Newsletter estimates that as many as nine 
                          percent of adolescents suffer from serious depression 
                          (Grinspoon, 1993). However, gender differences have 
                          been discovered in this domain: there are twice as many 
                          adolescent females as males suffering from depression 
                          (Glied &#38; Kofman, 1995; Greist, 1987; Grinspoon, 
                          1993; Mufson et al., 1993; Nolen- Hoeksema &#38; Girgus, 
                          1994; Singer, 1992). Many girls feel pain and confusion 
                          during adolescence. In addition, they are often expected 
                          to have emotional difficulties during this time period. 
                          But socially withdrawn adolescents with dramatic mood 
                          swings, cognitive distortions and increasing conflicts 
                          with parents and peers are not the norm and such behavior 
                          should be considered as possible manifestations of psychiatric 
                          illness (Mufson et al., 1993; Pipher, 1994). Similarly, 
                          Grinspoon (1993) suggests that serious despair, rage 
                          and suicidal fantasies are not the norm.

                          depression. The similarities include recurring symptoms 
                          of &#147;negative self-cognition, depressed mood, sleep 
                          and appetite disturbances, tearfulness, difficulty functioning 
                          at job or school due to poor concentration and suicidal 
                          ideation&#148; (Mufson et al., 1993, p. 25). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> There are some developmental differences 
                          between adolescent and adult depressives. Adolescents 
                          experience more hypersomnia and hyperphagia (i.e., sleeping 
                          and eating disorders) than do adults. An important distinction 
                          between these two groups is that depressed adolescents 
                          make more suicide attempts than depressed adults. Female 
                          adolescent depression has its own distinct causes. Girls 
                          are often unprepared for the bodily and social changes 
                          that mark their lives during this period. These changes 
                          engender feelings of shame, guilt and inferiority (Grinspoon, 
                          1993; McGrath et al., 1990; Mufson et al., 1993; Pipher, 
                          1994). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> There has been a substantial rise 
                          in the rate of adolescent suicide in the last 30 years. 
                          Suicide has been found to be correlated with depression 
                          in adolescents and one in three depressed adolescents 
                          has suicidal thoughts (McGrath et al., 1990; Nolen-Hoeksema, 
                          1990). Mary Pipher, a clinical psychologist and expert 
                          in the field of female adolescent psychotherapy, describes 
                          the manifestations of female adolescent depression in 
                          the following statement: 
                        <p> 
                        <ul>
                          <span class="graycopy"> It makes some adolescent girls 
                          sluggish and apathetic, others angry and hate-filled. 
                          Some girls manifest their depression by starving themselves 
                          or carving their bodies. Some withdraw and go deep within 
                          themselves and some swallow pills. Others drink heavily 
                          or are promiscuous. Whatever the outward form of the 
                          depression, the inward form is the grieving for the 
                          lost self, the authentic girl who has disappeared with 
                          adolescence. (1994, p. 149) </span> 
                        </ul>
                        <p class="graycopy"> There are many types of psychological 
                          and biochemical therapies that have been utilized for 
                          the treatment of depression in the adult population. 
                          But there are few studies that &#147;address the issue 
                          of differential effectiveness of treatment strategies 
                          for depressed female adolescents. It should not be surprising, 
                          therefore, that the literature on treatment outcomes 
                          for depressed female adolescents is almost nonexistent&#148; 
                          (McGrath et al., 1990, p. 83). The information that 
                          we do have indicates that therapeutic interventions 
                          that are effective for treating adult depression (e.g., 
                          traditional &#147;talk&#148; therapy and antidepressant 
                          drugs) are often ineffective for adolescents (Grinspoon, 
                          1993; Harrington, 1992; Mufson et al., 1993). Published 
                          studies on the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for depressed 
                          adolescents have not yielded significantly positive 
                          results (Garland, 1994; Harrington, 1992; Hazell, O&#146;Connell, 
                          Heathcote, Robertson, &#38; Henry, 1995; Kutcher et 
                          al., 1994). The reasons that adolescents fail to respond 
                          to antidepressant medication are not yet known (Grinspoon, 
                          1993; Mufson et al., 1993). Additionally, for some clients 
                          there are mild to serious side effects in response to 
                          antidepressant drug therapy (Johnsgard, 1989; Mufson 
                          et al., 1993). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Several contemporary writers suggest 
                          that a cost effective, alternative treatment is exercise 
                          therapy (Johnsgard, 1989; MacMahon, 1990; Stuhlmiller, 
                          1994; Welsh &#38; Labbe, 1994). A prescription for exercise 
                          can provide enrichment to the whole girl. Exercise can 
                          offer adolescent girls improved cognitions about their 
                          body image, self-esteem and competency. Exercise therapy 
                          can also promote physiological well-being with its increased 
                          energy and improved sleep and eating patterns (Johnsgard, 
                          1989; Martinsen &#38; Stephens, 1994).

                        <p class="graycopy"> Sadly, for some of today&#146;s adolescents 
                          and children, unchosen circumstances of their lives 
                          expose them to physical and sexual abuse, violence and 
                          disaster to such an extent they reflect the symptoms 
                          of Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (Parson, 1994; 
                          Wilson, 1994). Recent studies of institutionalized children 
                          from dysfunctional families identified eight common 
                          categories of stressors in their lifestyle (Wilson, 
                          1994). These stressors were said to have low-level, 
                          insidious effects which were compounded or additive 
                          over time producing symptoms similar to &#147;classic&#148; 
                          PTSD (Berk, 1992). The stressors include: (a) failure 
                          to provide positive role modeling, (b) failure to protect 
                          from continued trauma or aid to experience safety, (c) 
                          failure to provide structure, (d) failure to provide 
                          unconditional positive regard, (e) failure to teach 
                          suitable problem-solving methods, (f) failure to teach 
                          the norms of society, (g) chaotic, conflicted, &#147;abnormal&#148; 
                          environments which become the normal baseline of experience, 
                          and (h) high levels of inconsistency, unpredictability, 
                          role reversal and anxiety-inducing intrafamilial or 
                          interpersonal relationships. It is the position here, 
                          and throughout this section of the report, that the 
                          structural setting of sport and exercise programs can 
                          be organized to supply the antidote to the very deficits 
                          identified in the backgrounds of these children. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Unfortunately, there is a paucity 
                          of research on these matters. However, a few studies 
                          have shown that exposure to violence and family dysfunction 
                          is associated with PTSD symptomology among nonclinical 
                          children and adolescents (Foa, Riggs, &#38; Gershuney, 
                          1995; Schwarz &#38; Perry, 1994), male juvenile offenders 
                          (Burton, Fox, Bwanausi, Johnson, &#38; Moore, 1994) 
                          and male and female adolescents who have been physically 
                          abused (Pelcovitz et al., 1994). After a review of the 
                          literature (Miller-Perrin &#38; Wurtele, 1990), it was 
                          stated that &#147;clinical and empirical literature 
                          shows that PTSD symptomology often develops in adolescence 
                          and adulthood among female survivors of sexual abuse&#148; 
                          (p. 91). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In order to grasp the seriousness 
                          of this problem, it is necessary to estimate the prevalence 
                          of sexual abuse among adolescent females. In a recent 
                          random sample of 930 adult women, it was reported that, 
                          before the age of 17, 12 percent had experienced intrafamilial 
                          sexual abuse and 26 percent had been abused by someone 
                          not in the family (McGrath et al., 1990). Further, in 
                          a study of the records of 188 male and female psychiatric 
                          inpatients discharged over an 18-month period, 53 percent 
                          of females and 23 percent of males had been abused. 
                          Of the 28 patients who were adolescent, 75 percent had 
                          been abused (McGrath et al., 1990). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Exposure to violence and physical 
                          and sexual abuse is a phenomenon which cuts across social 
                          classes and neighborhoods. It has been pointed out, 
                          however, that additional forms of trauma, including 
                          ethnocultural strife and cultural alienation, can add 
                          layers of challenge for adolescents (Parson, 1994). 
                          Parson specifically describes &#147;post-traumatic ethnotherapy&#148; 
                          as a therapeutic orientation characterized by ethnic/cultural 
                          sensitivities. Such an orientation will enhance amelioration 
                          of the damages caused by stressors both natural (e.g., 
                          housefire, earthquake, hurricane) and political (e.g., 
                          being the victim of having a swastika placed in your 
                          yard or painted on your house, racial epithets directed 
                          toward you or your children). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In the PTSD literature, voices are 
                          calling for experimentation with and use of exercise 
                          and sport programs for therapeutic purposes. Stuhlmiller 
                          (1994) calls action-based programs &#147;one of the 
                          most powerful, yet generally overlooked approaches to 
                          PTSD&#148; (p. 386). One program, Ending Violence Effectively 
                          (EVE), was specifically designed for females who had 
                          been victims of rape, incest, physical and verbal assault, 
                          sexual harassment and other forms of trauma. In wilderness 
                          settings, traditional counseling was offered in addition 
                          to an action-based component which included &#147;movement 
                          and meditation, massage, relaxation training and hypnosis&#148; 
                          (p. 387). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> In order to provide a possible explanation 
                          for the effectiveness of exercise and sport programs, 
                          Stuhlmiller (1994) pointed out that over time, exposure 
                          to trauma has been shown to result in reduced production 
                          of serotonin, catecholamines, norepinephrine and endogenous 
                          opiods. These biochemical deficiencies are associated 
                          with the avoidance, emotional constriction and depressive 
                          symptoms characteristic of PTSD. As has been pointed 
                          out throughout this report, the role of regular exercise 
                          in increasing these chemical levels, thereby contributing 
                          to a heightened sense of well-being, has been substantiated 
                          (Page &#38; Tucker, 1994; Plante, 1993; Tuson &#38; 
                          Sinyor, 1993).

                        <p class="graycopy"> Much more research is needed regarding 
                          the effect of sport and exercise on female adolescent 
                          mental health, but promising findings are emerging in 
                          recent investigations. Holloway et al. (1988), studied 
                          the effectiveness of strength training on self-efficacy 
                          for adolescent girls. When these girls participated 
                          in free-weight training, they reported significant gains 
                          in self-efficacy and confidence levels. Participants 
                          experienced improvements in self-esteem for their bodies 
                          in particular and for their lives in general. In another 
                          study working with a junior high and high school population, 
                          more than three hundred adolescent girls reported an 
                          inverse relationship between experienced life stress 
                          and exercise participation. Based on longitudinal observations, 
                          Brown and Siegel (1988) concluded that exercise was 
                          a viable technique for stress reduction. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Koniak-Griffin (1994) conducted a 
                          study in which an aerobic exercise program was introduced 
                          to nonclinically depressed pregnant adolescents. The 
                          results demonstrated a significant decrease in depressive 
                          symptoms and an increase in total self-esteem. The researcher 
                          suggested that participation in the aerobic exercise 
                          program &#147;may have created general feelings of self-accomplishment 
                          among exercisers which offset symptoms of depression 
                          and reduced the adverse impact of the crisis of premature 
                          parenthood&#148; (p. 259). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Oler et al. (1994) explored the relationship 
                          between participation in athletics and depression, suicidal 
                          ideation and substance abuse in male and female adolescents. 
                          The researchers conducted a survey and compared high-school 
                          athletes to nonathletes. They report that &#147;Athletic 
                          participation is a marker for decreased likelihood of 
                          depression and some high-risk behaviors in adolescents,

                          also revealed that female athletes reported fewer suicide 
                          attempts than female nonathletes.

                          Norris et al. (1991) determined that aerobic training 
                          was effective, to a statistically significant degree, 
                          in improving psychological well-being. In a large study 
                          of the impact of exercise on psychosocial functioning 
                          in male and female high school students, Page and Tucker 
                          (1994) found that physically active adolescents tend 
                          to feel less lonely, shy and hopeless. 
                        <p class="graycopy"> Four studies were identified that 
                          focused on clinically diagnosed or special populations. 
                          Horn and Claytor (1993) found that exercise as a therapeutic 
                          intervention had the greatest impact on the self- esteem 
                          of emotionally disturbed youth. Studying a small group 
                          of inpatient adolescents, researchers Brown, Welsh, 
                          Labbe, Vitulli and Kulkarni (1992) found significant 
                          improvements in depression and anxiety due to an aerobic 
                          training procedure. Fridinger and Dehart (1993) studied 
                          an inpatient adolescent drug and alcohol treatment program 
                          that had a distinctive component of exercise and physical 
                          activity incorporated as an adjunct to the psychotherapy 
                          intervention process. Exercise was found to be an effective 
                          coping strategy for stressful situations: using a walk/jog 
                          procedure, the authors reported significant reductions 
                          in depression and anxiety levels. Similarly, MacMahon 
                          and Gross (1988) conducted a study on incarcerated adolescent 
                          males (ages 14 to 18) who participated in a three-month 
                          aerobic exercise program. They found a significant increase 
                          in self-concept and a decrease in depression levels.

                          Participants engage in three 45-minute small group exercise 
                          sessions per week. Each session consists of a variety 
                          of prescribed exercise experiences in stretching and 
                          warm-up activity, resistance and flexibility training 
                          and cardiovascular exercise (e.g., walking, jogging). 
                          The workouts are of moderate intensity in a noncompetitive 
                          setting. A &#147;buddy system&#148; is developed for 
                          the participants. A follow-up group class is conducted 
                          once a week for an entire year to promote program maintenance 
                          and to increase the chances of long-term success. Classes

                          (Plante, 1993, p. 373). Participation in exercise and 
                          sport enhances psychological well-being (Baumel, 1995;

                        <p class="graycopy"> Adolescent girls often have difficulties 
                          accepting the changes in their bodies; feelings of inferiority 
                          and insecurity haunt them (McGrath et al., 1990; Millstein, 
                          Petersen, &#38; Nightingale, 1993; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990). 
                          Exercise can provide a young girl with a positive image 
                          of her body&#151;of its capabilities, its power and 
                          agility. Participating in a physical activity can provide 
                          feelings of competence and success (Holloway et al., 
                          1988; Stein &#38; Motta, 1992; Vealey, 1992). &#147;Adolescents, 
                          whose problems are not particularly amenable to traditional 
                          forms of verbal psychotherapy, may also respond to an 
                          organized running program&#148; (Buffone, 1984, p. 221). 
                          When adolescent girls have some passion and strong interest 
                          in participating in activities, it &#147;can give them

                          &#147;exercise does operate as a buffering mechanism 
                          between stress and anxiety/depression&#148; (Norris 
                          et al., 1991, p. 63). 
                        <p class="graycopy"> There are feelings of powerlessness 
                          associated with adolescent depression and anxiety that 
                          can be counteracted by exercise and sport, where young 
                          girls and women can gain feelings of personal control 
                          (Stein &#38; Motta, 1992). Positive mental health is
