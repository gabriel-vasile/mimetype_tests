II. AIMS AND THE WOCE SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES</h2>
The WOCE goals and objectives were set in place more than a decade ago,
(WCRP, 1988) and remain the primary guide for WOCE. WOCE observations,
modelling and analysis have remained close to these goals even given the
passage of time. By the end of WOCE, most of these objectives will have
been achieved. The goals and objectives are:

<p>&nbsp;Goal 1: to develop models useful for predicting climate change
and to collect the data necessary to test them.

<p>&nbsp;Goal 2: to determine the representativeness of the specific WOCE
data sets for the long-term behaviour of the ocean, and to find methods
for determining long-term changes in the ocean circulation.

<p>&nbsp;Within Goal 1 the specific objectives are:

<p>&nbsp;To determine and understand on a global basis the following aspects
of the World Ocean circulation and their relation to climate:

<p>&nbsp;1. The large-scale fluxes of heat and fresh water; their divergences
over 5 years, and their annual and interannual variability.
<br>2. The dynamical balance of the World Ocean circulation and its response
to changing surface fluxes.
<br>3. Components of ocean variability on months to years, mega-metres
to global scale, and the statistics on smaller scales.
<br>4. The rates and nature of formation, ventilation and circulation of
water masses that influence the climate system on time scales from ten
to one hundred years.

<p>&nbsp;Within Goal 2 the specific objectives are:

<p>&nbsp;1. To determine the representativeness of the specific WOCE data
sets.
<br>2. To identify those oceanographic parameters, indices and fields that
are essential for continuing measurements in a climate observing system
on decadal time scales.
<br>3. To develop cost-effective techniques suitable for deployment in
an on-going climate observing system.

<p>&nbsp;Goal 1, towards ocean model development through improved understanding
of the circulation and dynamics, has evolved into the central focus of
WOCE. Goal 2 is being addressed through WOCE programmes which sample temporal
variability, and through assessment of the observational and modelling
strategies being used for Goal 1. Further planning and programmes to achieve
Goal 2 are being carried out now outside WOCE, in the Ocean Observation
Panel on Climate (OOPC), Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and Climate
variability and Predictability (CLIVAR).

<p>&nbsp;The next group of subsections examines each of the objectives,
assesses our current progress towards achieving them, and includes practical
recommendations for their pursuit during the remainder of WOCE. An earlier
assessment (1995) is found in the document &quot;The Status, Achievements and
Prospects for WOCE&quot;.

<p>&nbsp;<b>II.1. WOCE Goal 1: Ocean model improvements</b>

<p>&nbsp;&quot;To develop models useful for predicting climate change and to
collect the data necessary to test them.&quot;

<p>&nbsp;Models of the ocean include prognostic numerical models of varying
resolution and complexity as well as such models with data used heavily
as constraints (data assimilation). More broadly, they also include observation-based
analysis and interpretation and the theoretical understanding of ocean
processes. The general goal of improving ocean models must be approached
on several fronts. These include continuing development of the numerical
models themselves (Chapter IV), a detailed description of the ocean circulation
based on observations (Chapter III), model evaluation using this description,
development of data assimilation methods for the ocean (Chapter V), and
improved understanding of the dynamics of ocean processes, which can be
obtained through various combinations of all of these.

<p>&nbsp;The writers of the original objectives under Goal 1 recognised
the need for quantitative description of the ocean and its variability.
The outcome of such a description will be a rational planning of approaches
to model evaluation.

<p>&nbsp;&quot;To determine and understand on a global basis the following aspects
of the World Ocean circulation and their relation to climate:&quot;-

<p>&nbsp;<u>II.1.1. Heat and freshwater transports, divergences and variability</u>

<p>&nbsp;&quot;The large-scale fluxes of heat and fresh water; their divergences
over 5 years, and their annual and interannual variability.&quot;

<p>&nbsp;The most fundamental way in which the ocean influences climate
is by the storage and transport of heat and freshwater and through fluxes
across the air-sea interface. Coupled ocean-atmosphere models must simulate
these quantities accurately. Estimating the transport of heat and freshwater
and its variability is therefore one of the central objectives of WOCE.
Observationally-based estimates of these quantities range in complexity
from products based on traditional data analyses, through inverse modelling
and statistical combination of the various types of data, to assimilation
of the data in numerical models.

<p>&nbsp;Much of the design of the WOCE observations was influenced by
the need to estimate these transports and fluxes. The combination of the
WOCE Hydrographic Programme to provide geostrophic transport estimates,
current meter arrays for western boundary current transports, intermediate
depth floats for broad-scale reference velocity estimation, and the repeated
high density XBT sections to estimate variability was designed to provide
the best possible estimates of the transport across ocean sections. The
surface layer programmes - surface drifters, broad-scale XBTs, and surface
fluxes - were designed to provide information on the ageostrophic component
of transport, heat storage in the surface layer, and air-sea fluxes.

<p>&nbsp;Section II.1 summarises the WOCE plan for determining heat and
freshwater fluxes, the present state of knowledge of these fluxes, and
the steps required during the synthesis stage of WOCE if we are to achieve
the objective of accurate transport estimates for the global ocean. Most
emphasis in this section is placed on estimating the fluxes. However, the
divergences in the lateral fluxes are the quantities that are really required,
and these will be hindered by oceanic variability, especially by the seasonal
cycle. Sections II.1.3 and II.2.1 describe the approaches to estimating
variability.

<p>&nbsp;<i>II.1.1.a Direct estimates of transports across sections</i>

<p>&nbsp;Direct estimates of transports are based on in situ ocean observations.
WOCE observations were designed to provide good direct estimates of meridional
transport across one latitude in the subtropical gyre of each ocean and
somewhat less accurate estimates of transports for the remaining ocean
regions. At the designated subtropical &quot;heat flux sections&quot;, the observations
were to include a high quality hydrographic section, with western and eastern
boundary current moored arrays, (quarterly) repeated high density XBT sections,
and results from the global subsurface float and surface drifter programmes.
During the field implementation phase, it was generally decided that intensive
eastern boundary measurements are not essential, whereas western boundary
measurements are critically important. At other latitudes and longitudes,
a subset of the observations were obtained, and so only imperfect transport
estimates can be made.

<p>&nbsp;Central to the direct estimates of mass, heat and freshwater are
the geostrophic velocities derived from hydrographic sections; only these
have the required horizontal and vertical coverage. Their shortcomings
in terms of temporal coverage are mitigated by high density XBT sections
(where they exist) and by use of satellite altimetry. From measurements
of the density field along a section, the thermal wind relationship can
be used to estimate the geostrophic velocity relative to some level. The
contribution of the Ekman flux can be estimated from the wind stress and
assumptions of the Ekman layer depth. In some circumstances, especially
in low latitude regions of relatively steady winds, it can be estimated
from shipboard ADCP measurements. Surface drifters drogued at 15 metres
are also being used to estimate the ageostrophic surface layer component.

<p>&nbsp;Velocity and transport calculations based on hydrographic data
are non-trivial. First, the reference velocity for the thermal wind calculation
is unknown. Second, the hydrographic data do not resolve the temporal variability.
A major challenge for the analysis of all WOCE measurements is the interpretation
of the &quot;blurred snapshot&quot; provided by a large number of local synoptic
measurements spread out over a seven year period.

<p>&nbsp;Several methods exist to tackle the problem of the unknown reference
level velocity. Direct measurements of the absolute velocity at some level
can be made. WOCE is the first experiment to attempt to provide gyre-scale
subsurface reference velocities, relying on Lagrangian velocity measurements.
A global network of floats has been deployed at approximately 1000 metres
depth, and will come close to meeting the WOCE goal of 5 years of float
data per five degree square, except in the subpolar North Pacific. Additional
floats have been deployed in areas of special interest (Brazil Basin and
subpolar North Atlantic). Deriving transport estimates from a combination
of synoptic hydrographic sections and Lagrangian mean velocities is an
important research task to be pursued in the AIMS phase.

<p>&nbsp;Coherent current meter arrays in western boundary currents and
deep passages were deployed in WOCE to measure local transport and its
variability. A notable example of this type for WOCE is the Kuroshio transport
experiment, with current meters, TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter data, and rapidly
repeated hydrographic/ADCP sections. In regions of strong flows, ship-mounted
acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCP) can directly measure current
speeds with sufficient accuracy to improve transport estimates (Saunders
and King, 1995). More recently, lowered ADCPs have also been used to measure
absolute velocities. The errors in ADCP measurements are still too large
to provide a useful reference for transport calculations in regions of
quiet flow.

<p>&nbsp;The western boundary transport experiments were implemented in
WOCE for each subtropical gyre, in support of heat transport calculations
such as made by Hall and Bryden (1982), whose work provided the model for
the dedicated heat flux lines in WOCE. They recognised that because the
vertically-averaged temperature is nearly uniform across the basin at 24deg.N
in the Atlantic, all they needed to estimate the heat flux carried by the
barotropic velocity was its net transport, not its spatial distribution.
Given good measurements of the transport of the western boundary current,
the barotropic transport could be estimated by conserving total mass transport
across the section (including the Ekman transport). Where the vertically-averaged
temperature is not uniform, the spatial distribution of the reference level
velocity must still be determined. The reference level velocity also needs
to be determined on WOCE sections where the boundary current transports
are not measured.

<p>&nbsp;Where broad-scale reference velocities are required, WOCE will
use a combination of the subsurface float velocities and older methods
using hydrographic data alone. In the latter, the first step is the careful
consideration of property distributions, yielding an initial set of reference
velocities which ensure that water masses spread away from their sources.
This must be done judiciously, since recirculating flows can carry water
&quot;the wrong way&quot; at a particular station pair; time-varying currents can
carry water toward the inferred source at a particular time; and the contributions
of advection and diffusion can be difficult to unravel from property distributions
alone. The new float information may reduce the need for subjectivity in
these choices.

<p>&nbsp;The second step is to ensure near balance of mass in carefully
chosen layers. This second step is so difficult that only Reid (1994 inter
alia) has attempted basin-wide balances without the use of inverse methods.
The inverse method, first applied to oceanographic problems by Wunsch (1978),
combines observations and dynamics to infer those aspects of the circulation
which are not observed directly, such as velocity from hydrographic data.
Important to the success of inverse methods is the initial guess for the
reference velocities; the inverse method machinery then provides a solution
for velocities and other unknowns, such as vertical velocity or mixing
coefficients, consistent with all prior information, along with error bars.
Inverse methods have been used many times to estimate property transports.
Indeed, many would argue that at present our best estimates of ocean heat,
salt and freshwater fluxes are the result of such inversions.

<p>&nbsp;The second difficulty with direct estimates of transports is temporal
variability, including seasonal to interannual to decadal time scales,
since the WOCE observation period encompassed almost a decade. Transport
estimates derived from WOCE sections are likely to be aliased. We do not
yet understand enough about the seasonal variability in ocean heat transport
and storage to be able to &quot;correct&quot; for such aliasing. In order to provide
realistic guides to the uncertainty in WOCE transport estimates, we need
to examine the repeat measurements that do exist, as well as analyse the
results of high-resolution, seasonally-forced ocean models. This issue
of representativeness of the single snapshot of transports is discussed
in II.2.1.

<p>&nbsp;Estimates of heat and freshwater transports are already being
constructed for each of the WOCE subtropical heat flux lines. This work
is currently in progress, awaiting for example complete western boundary
current results, an assessment of representativeness based on XBT and other
temporal sampling, assembly of information about Ekman layer fluxes, and
a consistent circulation scheme for the whole of the basin. Publication
will begin shortly, in part in workshop publications. Similar analyses
will continue through the end of WOCE, expanding to include the sections
for which special boundary measurements were not made, and employing the
variety of techniques described above.

<p>&nbsp;Eventually the best estimates of ocean heat and freshwater transports
and divergences will be derived from a model which assimilates the wide
variety of WOCE measurements and dynamically interpolates between the sparse
observations. <b><i>But initially, heat, freshwater and tracer transports
estimated from ocean observations with simple inverse models are likely
to provide the benchmark against which models, both forward and data-assimilating,
are judged. Vigorous prosecution of this work is recommended, including
all of the ancillary circulation issues, recognising it to be of high priority.</i></b>

<p>&nbsp;II.1.1.b Indirect estimates

<p>&nbsp;Ocean heat and freshwater transports are estimated indirectly
in two ways. The air-sea heat flux can be integrated over the surface area
of a region of ocean to obtain a measure of the oceanic heat transport
divergence in that region. However, the lack of observations in the oceanic
and atmospheric boundary layer, and uncertainties in the bulk formulae
used to estimate heat fluxes from such observations, means that estimates
of oceanic heat flux calculated in this way have large error bars (Talley,
1984). Moisan and Niiler (1996) have used seasonal heat storage in the
ocean as a way of calibrating the bulk formulae, and produced new versions
of surface heat fluxes. The heat storage calculations were based primarily
on broad-scale XBT profiles. Their flux calculations incorporate the most
recent developments in measuring fluxes from satellite data as well as
those using ship observations.

<p>&nbsp;Major progress in improving the surface flux values is expected
in WOCE. This progress is also necessary for broader reasons - ocean models
are forced by the observed fluxes, and coupled models must have fluxes
which are similar to those that are observed. It was anticipated that the
direct estimates of heat transports from WOCE measurements would provide
sufficient information, in the form of divergences between sections, to
constrain the surface fluxes. However it is yet to be proved that this
is possible from the one-time hydrographic survey sections alone because
of the temporal variability, including seasonal variations. It may be that
methods using the repeated high density XBT sections combined with the
hydrography will be more likely to succeed.

<p>&nbsp;The second indirect method for calculating the ocean's heat transport
is by subtracting the atmospheric heat transport from the heat flux at
the top of the atmosphere calculated from satellite measurements (e.g.,
Carissimo et al., 1985). Until recently, such estimates of ocean heat transport
have differed significantly from direct estimates of ocean heat transport
(Bryden, 1993). However, recent residual calculations by Trenberth and
Solomon (1994) and Keith (1995) are much closer to the direct oceanographic
estimates. These authors suggest that earlier residual calculations suffered
from biases in the satellite measurements and poor estimates of the atmospheric
heat transport over the sparsely observed regions of the ocean.

<p>&nbsp;During the remaining years of WOCE, indirect heat transport estimates
may be improved through increasing use of satellite-based surface fluxes,
through the reanalysis projects of ECMWF and NCEP, through the flux evaluations
carried out by the WOCE flux SAC, and through the activities of the SCOR/WCRP
working group on air-sea fluxes. <b><i>A long-term target of the highest
priority is mutual consistency of the indirect and direct estimates of
air-sea fluxes.</i></b>

<p>&nbsp;II.1.2. <u>Description of the World Ocean Circulation and dynamical
balances</u>

<p>&nbsp;&quot;The dynamical balance of the World Ocean circulation and its
response to changing surface fluxes.&quot;

<p>&nbsp;With the expansion of data sets that have become available over
the past several decades, oceanographers have come to realise that the
concept of a &quot;mean&quot; circulation is elusive. Variability exists at all time
scales and the frequency spectrum is generally red. As we move into the
post-WOCE era, increasing emphasis is being put on the changing ocean state
at time scales ranging from annual to decadal. However, in order to make
progress at understanding these longer time scales of variability, a requirement
of WOCE is to provide as complete a picture as is possible of the present
state of the ocean. This implies the construction of data sets that can
be used not only for the purposes of model evaluation improvement but also
for a better understanding of the dynamics of ocean circulation.

<p>&nbsp;As the ocean is driven primarily at its surface through a combination
of buoyancy and momentum fluxes, an essential ingredient in the improvement
of models will come through more accurate estimation of these fluxes and
a better understanding of upper ocean physics. For example, the way in
which the surface mixed layer couples to the interior was the focus of
the WOCE Subduction experiment and much of the North Atlantic WOCE programme,
and efforts should continue to compare those data sets and sparse data
sets obtained from anthropogenic tracers with appropriate model output.

<p>&nbsp;At long time scales, mixing across isopycnals returns the deep
and bottom water to the thermocline and, ultimately, back to polar regions
where it can begin its journey anew. The cross-isopycnal mixing remains
one of the least understood of ocean processes but one of the most important
for the long time behaviour of climate models. Two WOCE experiments were
charged with the task of quantifying the rate of cross-isopycnal mixing:
the Tracer Release Experiments (TREs) and the Deep Basin Experiment. These
have directly determined the rate of mixing in a small number of locations
in the ocean (i.e. in the upper thermocline of the eastern subtropical
North Atlantic, in the sub-arctic, and in parts of the deep Brazil Basin).
The comparison of these direct measures of mixing with associated measurements
by the newly vigorous programmes employing microstructure probes, lowered
ADCP observations, and measurements of flow through deep passages should
permit extrapolation to a much wider area, using the much broader WOCE
data sets.

<p>&nbsp;The last observational focus in WOCE, that in the North Atlantic
in 1996-1997, is aimed at an accurate description of the circulation on
a seasonal and, through earlier observations in the same region, on interannual
time scales. This is an important issue in the context of model development
and evaluation and there are additional WOCE observations that address
this subject. The VOS XBT programme gives the best description of the upper
ocean through the WOCE observation period and good coverage has been obtained
in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

<p>&nbsp;Essential to determining the dynamical balances is a basic description
of the circulation. The observations and models which contribute to the
goal of estimating heat transports (II.1.1) most importantly contribute
to this description. Globally, the WOCE Hydrographic Programme, the subsurface
floats, the surface drifters, and the current meter arrays and other measurements
in critical passages and boundary currents will be used for the circulation
description. The efforts described in detail in section II.1.1 to estimate
the circulation, and hence its transports, are what are required for the
basic description.

<p>&nbsp;<b><i>An understanding of the dynamical balances in different
areas of the ocean will come through the understanding of particular processes
revealed through the description of the circulation and the process experiments
mentioned above, and importantly through tests of balances in ocean models
(Chapter IV). In order to be useful, the numerical models must be provided
with good forcing functions and evaluated against each other and against
the observationally-based description of the circulation.</i></b>

<p>&nbsp;II.1.3 <u>Variations and statistics of the circulation and forcing</u>

<p>&nbsp;&quot;Components of ocean variability on months to years, mega-metres
to global scale, and the statistics on smaller scales.&quot;

<p>&nbsp;Although the primary goal of WOCE is to obtain a description of
the global ocean circulation, this snapshot requires context and some estimation
of its reliability (i.e. errors). There are various activities within WOCE
which will provide suitable information.

<p>&nbsp;The global survey has taken nearly a decade to complete, with
individual basins being surveyed over a wide range of periods (see II.2.1).
The consequent aliasing that is possible from this sampling procedure needs
to be assessed. Several programmes were designed to assess variability.
The Voluntary Observing Ship programme, although undersubscribed, has been
successful in using XBTs to obtain relevant information on upper ocean
variability over the WOCE period in both the Atlantic and Pacific, with
somewhat sparser coverage in the Indian Ocean. The repeat hydrography programme
was designed to monitor variability at the important heat flux lines and
so-called &quot;choke points&quot; crossing the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Some
of the WOCE repeat hydrography consisted of only a few repeats of key sections;
these have largely been done. That which is more difficult is maintenance
of long time series, and these have been sustained where there is large
local interest and support - in the western and north-eastern North Pacific,
the Southwest Pacific, south of Australia, and in the subpolar North Atlantic.
Repeat hydrography includes time series stations which have, likewise,
been given lower priority so that there are records at just 6 of the 19
proposed locations. Several of these records are of quite long duration.
These data sets should provide basic information on seasonal and longer
period changes in the upper ocean circulation and heat storage over the
WOCE period.

<p>&nbsp;On the global scale the various satellite altimeters are expected
to continue providing high quality measurements of sea surface elevation
through to the project's completion. Through measurement of the sea surface
elevation (and surface velocity through the geostrophic relation), this
is the one observational platform that will yield data on the circulation
and its variability which is well sampled in both space and time. As sea
surface height changes are dominated by the first dynamical mode (Stammer
et al., 1996) the altimeter does provide information on the internal dynamics
of the circulation (heat storage, thermocline depth variability), but this
is not unambiguous. A research topic for continuing WOCE and altimetric
analysis is to reduce the ambiguities. The prospect of a dedicated gravity
mission within the next few years means that there will be extensive reanalysis
and re-interpretation of the altimeter data.

<p>&nbsp;The surface velocity programme has deployed drifters over much
of the globe and they are continuing to give information on velocities
within the mixed layer and, when combined with estimation of the geostrophic
component from the satellite altimeter, the Ekman component. The extensive
subsurface float programme will contribute to the estimation of circulation
fields and their statistics at subthermocline depths where attempts to
estimate the circulation from hydrography have significant errors.

<p>&nbsp;Although the moored current meter component of WOCE covered a
number of global locations, the records are of limited duration, and are
generally focused on boundary current and deep inter-basin transports,
providing little information about large-scale circulation variability.
However at these sites they provide excellent information about seasonal
variability, and will be helpful in understanding the vertical structure
associated with surface elevation variability as measured by the altimeter.
(Observations in the Kuroshio furnish just such an example, Imawaki et
al., 1997).

<p>&nbsp;Analysis of variability in the WOCE period will also be aided
by high resolution ocean models forced by time varying surface fluxes.
The models will need to be realistic (Chapter IV) as too will the forcing
(II.1.1b and II.3.7). At present models clearly underestimate variability
(Stammer et al 1996) but if this is shown to be consistent over a wide
range of sites for various data types they could still yield an expansion
in knowledge. But the gradual convergence of models on the behaviour of
the ocean will provide the most certain overview of global ocean variability.

<p>&nbsp;<b><i>A joint approach to variability using the various WOCE and
satellite data sets and ocean models will provide the context needed to
evaluate the principal description of the circulation. The analysis will
also lead to solidly-based recommendations for future climate observing
systems.</i></b>

<p>&nbsp;II.1.4 <u>Rates and nature of water mass formation and ventilation</u>

<p>&nbsp;&quot;The rates and nature of formation, ventilation and circulation
of water masses that influence the climate system on time scales from ten
to one hundred years.&quot;

<p>&nbsp;Water masses have traditionally been defined on the basis of well-observed
properties e.g., temperature, salinity, oxygen, and nutrients. More recently,
a variety of natural and anthropogenic trace substances have been added
to the list of those used in water mass analyses. Of special interest in
the context of water mass formation rates and mean residence times are
tracers which carry time information through their time-dependent delivery
to the ocean (transient tracers: e.g., tritium/He- 3 or CFCs), or through
their radioactive decay (e.g., C- 14).

<p>&nbsp;It has been recognised from the beginning of the WOCE planning
process that the direct observation of water mass formation and the determination
of their production rates are difficult and may not be achieved on a scale
that provides accurate estimates of the total or annual mean rates of formation
and transformation of specific water masses (Scientific Plan for the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment; WCRP, 1986). However, the identification
of sources of specific water masses based on these properties does reveal
significant information on the general circulation patterns of the ocean,
especially in the deep ocean. Combining volumetric census techniques with
velocities obtained from geostrophic calculations, also aided by inverse
analysis, as well as from Lagrangian or Eulerian measurements, provides
information on fluxes of specific water masses. Tracers carrying time information
yield additional constraints on formation rates, mean spreading velocities,
and mean residence times. Thus data-only studies will provide partial answers
to the questions above and these will undoubtedly be assisted by the analysis
of high resolution numerical ocean models.

<p>&nbsp;<b><i>During the phase of WOCE AIMS when assimilation tools and
resources for implementation become available, the synthesis of high resolution
models and WOCE data will produce the best estimates of both regional and
global estimates of water mass formation, spreading, and alteration.</i></b>

<p>&nbsp;<b>II.2. WOCE Goal 2</b>

<p>&nbsp;&quot;To determine the representativeness of the specific WOCE data
sets for the long-term behaviour of the ocean, and to find methods for
determining long-term changes in the ocean circulation.&quot;

<p>&nbsp;The first goal of WOCE has been pursued vigorously by the many
participating nations, with particular emphasis on large-scale hydrography,
current meter arrays, measurements to determine a five-to-ten year mean
circulation, and global ocean models which best depict the circulation.
The second goal, to examine the representativeness of WOCE observations
and to determine how to observe climate change in a cost-effective way,
has not been pursued as vigorously. The planning and discussion of these
issues is now continuing largely outside WOCE. However, it is clear that
several of the major WOCE data streams are particularly well suited to
address these issues. In this section are reviewed the ways in which WOCE
observations and models address representativeness and design of a climate
observing system.

<p>&nbsp;<u>II.2.1. Representativeness of WOCE data sets</u>

<p>&nbsp;&quot;To determine the representativeness of the specific WOCE data
sets.&quot;

<p>&nbsp;The issue of representativeness is a major problem facing analysts
in the synthesis phase of WOCE. It was recognised during the planning of
WOCE that in order to address Goal 2, requirements were:

<p>&nbsp;1. That the one-time hydrographic survey should be as close as
possible to a synoptic snapshot in each ocean basin.

<p>&nbsp;2. That measurements of temporal variability would be required
in order to interpret the one-time survey.

<p>&nbsp;Synopticity of WOCE data sets is an issue at time scales from
several weeks to seasonal and interannual. In the WOCE context, it is usually
considered on the latter interannual time scale - if the survey could be
completed during one phase of an interannual variation such as El Nino
or the North Atlantic Oscillation, then it could be reasonably considered
representative of the large-scale state of the ocean. However, seasonality
can be a severe problem, an example being in the monsoon- dominated tropical
Indian Ocean. The one-time survey is not synoptic in the seasonal sense.
The Indian Ocean observations were closest to the design concept for interannual
variability: most observations were completed or begun during a single
year. Also, repeats of many Indian Ocean sections provide some information
on seasonality. Portions of the Atlantic survey were also completed synoptically
in the interannual sense, with excellent coverage in 1996-1997, and reasonably
good coverage early in WOCE. The frequency of repeat hydrographic observations
in the North Atlantic in WOCE makes this perhaps the best-sampled of all
basins in WOCE.

<p>&nbsp;The South Atlantic, Pacific and Southern Ocean hydrographic surveys
were conducted over several years, and thus the synopticity requirement
was compromised. For instance, for the Pacific Ocean, the one-time survey
was spread out over several years time. Additionally, several zonal transects
which had been occupied during the 1980s were not repeated. Thus the Pacific
survey as a whole spans about a decade in time. It is not uniform in the
sampling of tracers or in coverage with neutrally buoyant floats (few floats
were deployed in the north-eastern Pacific).

<p>&nbsp;Sampling in the time domain was and is a critical part of the
WOCE observations, and has been described in detail in section 2.1.3. Its
purpose was threefold: to measured the &quot;blurredness&quot; of a basin snapshot,
to relate the snapshot(s) to a contemporary mean estimate of the global
circulation and finally to leave in place a network of observations for
the determination of long-term changes in ocean circulation. This third
aim should include careful evaluation of the usefulness of the network:
effective types of observations, their temporal and spatial resolution,
and technical methods for making the observations.

<p>&nbsp;There was mixed success in implementing the plan for sampling
in the time domain. On the positive side, the TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter
continues to provide data exceeding expectations in accuracy. The development
of a profiling version of the ALACE float will provide, together with repeat
hydrography in the North Atlantic, an unprecedented view of the evolving
large-scale density structure over much of that ocean basin. In the Pacific,
implementation of the high resolution XBT/XCTD network has been completed.
On the negative side, delays in the launch of TOPEX/POSEIDON, together
with the incorporation of pre-WOCE sections into the Pacific survey, meant
that only part of the Pacific hydrographic survey has contemporaneous altimetric
coverage. An ambitious plan for repeat hydrography in WOCE was abbreviated
and only one new time-series station was initiated. Indeed most of the
temporal measurement systems of WOCE were reduced substantially from the
programme design.

<p>&nbsp;Because of the success of TOPEX/POSEIDON, ERS-1 and ERS-2 satellites
and the relatively strong programme of upper ocean measurements, including
thermal profiling floats and drifters, many of the representativeness issues
can be addressed. An illustration was provided for the P14C hydrographic
line (Auckland-Suva) by Roemmich and Cornuelle (1993) using a collinear
high resolution XBT track which has been repeated quarterly since 1986.
The work showed that, indeed, the P14C transect had a net upper ocean transport
which was nearly equal to the long-term mean and that the boundary-to-boundary
transport integral had lower variance than boundary-to-ocean interior integrals
(a design &quot;concept&quot; of the WOCE survey). The comparison also showed that
the P14C transect contained a seven-year high in the inventory of Subtropical
Mode Water, an anomalously strong frontal system, and anomalous shear in
the intermediate water levels occupied by floats. The explicit trade-off
of spatial smoothing for a higher degree of representativeness on large
spatial scales was formally demonstrated.

<p>&nbsp;The representativeness of deep-ocean data is less easily assessed.
While there are a number of moored arrays in the deep western boundary
currents, there are no measurements of the variability of ocean-wide integrals
of deep transport during WOCE and just a few measurements of deep variability
at choke points. The upper ocean measurements provide only modest guidance
for interpretation of the deep snapshots. Difficult issues to be confronted
include: how to combine the 5-year mean velocity of the floats with the
deep shear fields of the snapshot sections, and how to interpret transport
differences (or indeed similarities) from adjacent hydrographic transects
in inverse models or other synthesis techniques.

<p>&nbsp;The extent to which the WOCE observations are representative of
long-term conditions also depends on the quantity being estimated. For
instance, meridional heat transport across 24deg.N in the Atlantic was
estimated from three separate sections, decades apart. Whereas the overall
distribution of temperature, and hence heat content, throughout the depth
and width of the section is significantly different from one section to
the next, the meridional heat transport is virtually the same in all three
cases, due to a change in the current structure (Parrilla et al., 1994).
Much additional work, including analysis of seasonal data, is required
to determine whether this result is fundamental or simply coincidental,
and the extent to which it might be true of other locations in the ocean.

<p>&nbsp;<b><i>Analyses of WOCE data for the next few years will be based
primarily on the data sets themselves, with at most the use of fairly simple
inverse models. By the end of WOCE, assimilation of the time dependent
WOCE data in models will provide a new and systematic means for evaluating
the representative nature of the ocean circulation seen in the WOCE snapshot.</i></b>

<p>&nbsp;The WOCE data set is a baseline against which in future years
we will be able to detect the oceanic aspects of climate change. Clearly
it is also a dataset which can be compared with past observations. In most
cases, historic observations are less accurate than the present and may
exist only in the form of discrete samples. Nevertheless if the change
in ocean properties is large enough neither accuracy nor wide sampling
will hide it. An example of such a comparison is that of Parrilla et al
(1994) in the North Atlantic.

<p>&nbsp;<b><i>It is recommended that, wherever possible, a systematic
comparison be made of WOCE data (principally hydrography) with earlier
data sets in order to establish the nature and extent of ocean climate
change. Synthesis of all of the WOCE data sets which observe time dependence,
and some of the historical data sets, is essential for determining the
representativeness of the large-scale WOCE results.</i></b>

<p>&nbsp;II.2.2. <u>Design of a climate observing system</u>

<p>&nbsp;&quot;To identify those oceanographic parameters, indices and fields
that are essential for continuing measurements in a climate observing system
on decadal time scales.&quot;

<p>&nbsp;In stating its goals, WOCE science planning looked ahead to the
use of WOCE results for designing a system for long term climate measurement.
As it became apparent that WOCE's primary emphasis would be on gathering
observations and improving ocean models for the ten-year &quot;mean&quot; circulation
and its temporal context rather than on designing climate observing systems
per se, and as it became apparent that WOCE results would not be available
until well after the time when observing system design should have been
completed, this climate objective was taken over by the Ocean Observing
System Development Panel (OOSDP). This panel was formed to create such
a plan, and presented its final report in March 1995 (The Global Ocean
Observing System or GOOS). Subsequently a proposal has been put forward
to demonstrate the practicality of routine real-time global ocean data
assimilation and prediction through a Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment
(GODAE). Meanwhile, CLIVAR DecCen, the climate research programme emphasising
inter alia decadal and longer-term change, was created. While CLIVAR's
developing science plan is significantly different from that of WOCE, it
will draw on many of the WOCE types of observations, technologies, and
models, as well as fundamental understanding of the ocean from WOCE.

<p>&nbsp;It is clear that many of the observing systems and modelling which
WOCE has developed or strengthened are central to long-term observations.
Results from WOCE will and are making a difference in planning for climate
observing systems. GOOS and CLIVAR DecCen have begun the process of identifying
the most useful observations. The most important of those which are envisioned
to remain deployed continuously after WOCE include the XBT/XCTD network;
surface drifters equipped variously with SST, atmospheric pressure and
conductivity; subsurface profiling floats; upgraded sea level network stations;
limited island time series stations. Observations which were considered
but not implemented extensively in WOCE might nevertheless prove useful
- examples would be moored profiling CTD stations or bottom pressure gauges
in critical ocean locations. In addition, the decadal variability made
clear by repeat occupations of hydrographic sections in the Atlantic and
Pacific and at time series stations reveal the usefulness of occasional
(decadal) re-occupation's of key sections for which multiple occupancies
already exist.

<p>&nbsp;In the WOCE analysis phase we are confident of deriving a better
knowledge and understanding of the ocean circulation and of the ocean's
role in climate. This will undoubtedly enable us to make better choices
of the key elements of the observing system. We might expect, for example,
that in the WOCE analysis, the relative importance of various choke point
and inter-basin exchange measurements, and boundary current monitoring
climate change will be evaluated so that the long-term measurements required
can be assured and superfluous measurements avoided.

<p>&nbsp;<b><i>Ocean models, data analysis and data assimilation efforts
developed as part of WOCE will eventually result in the ability to design
an ocean observing system, and to test the usefulness of various elements
of such a system, including the type of measurement and its temporal and
spatial distribution. The most useful of the elements will be those which
provide the strongest constraints on model prediction and the most marked
improvement in the description of the ocean circulation and its dynamical
balances. Each WOCE workshop should include a focus on the usefulness of
WOCE observations and modelling for detecting climate change, and provide
recommendations for future observation and modelling systems.</i></b>

<p>&nbsp;&quot;To develop cost-effective techniques suitable for deployment
in an on-going climate observing system.&quot;

<p>&nbsp;The OOSDP final report details the goals of a climate observing
system and the measurements and models which are likely to be required
in three areas: surface fields and surface fluxes, the upper ocean, and
the interior ocean. Variables to be observed include: sea surface temperature
and salinity, surface wind, air-sea heat and water fluxes, heat and freshwater
transports and budgets, upper ocean temperature, salinity and velocity,
sea level, sea ice, carbon, and measures of full-ocean circulation and
properties. Characteristics of observations are that they be long term,
systematic, relevant, continually examined, cost effective, timely, and
routine. Information management is an important part of the system.

<p>&nbsp;WOCE has provided the impetus for many of the new measurement
techniques and/or measurement strategies which will be used extensively
in the climate observing system. It has also provided models of some of
the infrastructure which is likely to be useful for climate observing systems.
Technical developments which have or will contribute to GOOS are:

<p>&nbsp;* widespread and near real time exploitation of satellite measurements
(altimetry, winds, temperatures)

<p>&nbsp;* improvements in surface drifters including addition of various
sensors (SST, SSS and SLP) and choice of best drogue type and depth

<p>&nbsp;* improvement of air-sea flux data sets and contributions to air-sea
flux comparison studies

<p>&nbsp;* development of XBT and XCTD technology towards deeper profiling
and more useful salinity sampling

<p>&nbsp;* development of the profiling autonomous subsurface float, including
temperature and salinity profiling

<p>&nbsp;* development of lowered acoustic Doppler profiling techniques,
allowing direct velocity measurements from a lowered rosette

<p>&nbsp;* exploitation of GPS navigation, both in position and heading

<p>&nbsp;* development of a practical large rosette/CTD system with an
improved computer-controlled pylon

<p>&nbsp;* development of the &quot;fast-fish&quot; CTD

<p>&nbsp;* large expansion of automated mass spectrometer measurements
for carbon- 14

<p>&nbsp;* automation and improvement of oxygen analysis technique

<p>&nbsp;* development of distributed data management systems and streamlined
data acquisition systems, with greatly increased data accessibility due
to the internet and CD-ROMs.

<p>&nbsp;WOCE observation networks and strategies which contribute to observing
climate:

<p>&nbsp;* initiation of repeated, intensively-sampled XBT/XCTD sections
across key areas of the circulation

<p>&nbsp;* expansion and continuation of mid-latitude low-density upper
ocean XBT observations

<p>&nbsp;* initiation of global deployments of surface drifters and subsurface
floats

<p>&nbsp;* expansion of in situ sea level systems

<p>&nbsp;* measurements of transports at key inter-basin exchange locations

<p>&nbsp;* 1990's hydrographic survey, including chemical tracers and CO<sub>2</sub>.

<p>&nbsp;Meanwhile WOCE analysis is taking advantage of improvements in
observations: various satellite measurements, especially altimetry, sea
surface temperature, and satellite-derived surface flux and wind information;
stable and precise pressure gauges; improved long-term conductivity measurements;
and new developments in navigation (GPS) and bathymetry (multi-beam systems)

<p>&nbsp;No new ocean-going instruments will be developed as part of WOCE
from this point forward since the field phase of WOCE terminates in 1997/1998.
However, WOCE will continue to provide developments in observation analysis
techniques, such as for the profiling float and lowered ADCP, improvements
in air-sea fluxes through comparisons of various products, improvements
in data systems, and data assimilation techniques.

<p>&nbsp;<b><i>The techniques developed in WOCE should be systematically
assessed for their usefulness in future observing systems. Most of this
assessment will take place through thorough analysis of the data sets in
combination with models and, eventually, data assimilation techniques.</i></b>

<p>&nbsp;WOCE data management structure has developed alongside, and in
some instances with, that of TOGA and various national and international
agencies. The data system in place now is distributed where it is associated
with data collection and assembly, and centralised for archiving. Data
managers for international data centres have been closely involved in the
development of WOCE data structures and, providing they continue to be
supported, the systems now in place will continue and evolve as the observing
system and technology grow and change.

<p>&nbsp;The climate observing system will include as major components
the best models of the ocean and atmosphere. WOCE scientists have been
making large strides in ocean model improvement, and the years of WOCE
AIMS should see a steady growth in ocean data assimilation capability.
Both of these topics are the subjects of succeeding chapters (IV and V
).

<p>&nbsp;<b>II.3 Workshops and publications for synthesis of WOCE results</b>

<p>&nbsp;To stimulate progress towards completion of WOCE goals WOCE workshops
are planned. They will bring together investigators who are concentrating
on WOCE problems through observations, modelling or data assimilation,
and present work already accomplished or in progress. Regional and global
workshops serve as a focal point for completion of and assembly of the
data sets for those geographical regions. Modelling and assimilation workshops
serve as focal points for planning comparison projects. The workshop organising
committees themselves play an important although ad hoc role in reaching
WOCE objectives. These committees have the closest oversight and view of
the work being done in their area of interest. It is proposed that each
of the committees continue beyond the period of workshop organising, in
roles as publication committees, and perhaps in the case of the modelling
and assimilation committees, as principal advisors to the SSG on modelling
and assimilation matters.

<p>&nbsp;<u>II.3.1. Regional workshops</u>

<p>&nbsp;Workshops focused on results for each ocean region have been scheduled.
The first three of these, for the Pacific, South Atlantic and Southern
Oceans, have been held. The report and recommendations from the Pacific
workshop have been published. Special publications for each of these three
regional workshops are moving forward, using Journal of Geophysical Research.
The Indian Ocean workshop is scheduled for 1998 and the North Atlantic
workshop for 1999.

<p>&nbsp;<u>II.3.2. WOCE Conference and the Global workshop (1998, 2000
or 2001)</u>

<p>&nbsp;The WOCE goals are global rather than regional. For practical
reasons of data collection, model resolution and analysis, and simply the
importance of complete understanding of regional processes, the WOCE workshops
were originally structured around ocean basins. However, there are processes,
analyses, data sets and models which are best discussed in a global context.
An example of such a process is the overturning circulation for the global
ocean. Phenomena which are common to all oceans are subduction, the eddy
variability of subtropical regions versus equatorial regions, mode water
formation, and mixing, among many possible examples. Data sets which are
almost always analysed in a global fashion are altimetry and other satellite
products, sea surface temperature, and air-sea flux estimates. The other
WOCE data sets should begin to be viewed in a more global fashion than
is done in the regional workshops. Most of the large modelling centres
are running global models of varying resolution at this point.

<p>&nbsp;The WOCE Conference scheduled for 1998 in Halifax will focus on
reporting of WOCE results to date. Workshops should be organised around
the conference to deal with particular global scientific issues.

<p>&nbsp;A global workshop late in WOCE, and following naturally from the
regional workshops, will focus on analysis and synthesis of the global
datasets and models. Its purpose will be to assess work in progress and
encourage new collaborations and work towards completion of WOCE goals.

<p>&nbsp;<u>II.3.3. Ocean modelling and data assimilation workshops (1998
and 1999/2000)</u>

<p>&nbsp;The modelling workshop described in section IV.4.1 below will
address both specific technical modelling issues and also analysis of models
in terms of the broad WOCE scientific goals. The workshop will be co-sponsored
by the WOCE SMWG and the CLIVAR NEG-2 committees. The organising committee
is expected to take a central role both during and after the workshop.

<p>&nbsp;A data assimilation workshop later in WOCE is proposed (section
V.5 below). Like the modelling workshop, while there will be much discussion
of technical methods, the principal focus of the workshop will be on the
results obtained from data assimilation in light of the WOCE scientific
goals.

<p>&nbsp;<u>II.3.4. Publications</u>

<p>&nbsp;The ultimate legacy of WOCE includes the published intellectual
contributions of the many scientists involved in WOCE, printed and on-line
data products which have evolved from atlases, and ultimately reviews and
monographs. Each of the WOCE workshop committees will take as a central
function the co-ordination of immediate publications relating to the primary
workshop topics. The SMWG and SSG will coordinate these initial publication
efforts, and stimulate further publications such as reviews. The SSG will
periodically review progress in publications, and establish as needed ad
hoc committees to coordinate publication series.
