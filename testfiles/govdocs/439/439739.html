In an effort to assess the capabilities and limitations of human spatial vision, the present study
investigated the individual and combined effects of the visual stressors of low luminance,
alcohol consumption, stimulus motion and glare on contrast sensitivity for sine-wave gratings
of different spatial frequencies.  A secondary purpose was to explore the relationships among
indices of intoxication, dark focus of accommodation and contrast sensitivity performance. 
Twelve naive subjects participated in two experimental sessions:  Placebo (subjects expected
alcohol but received only a negligible amount) and Alcohol (subjects expected and received
95% grain alcohol; mean breath alcohol content [BAC] = 0.073%).  Contrast sensitivity was
determined for 1.5, 3 and 6 cycles per degree gratings that were either stationary or traveled
through a circular path, requiring pursuit eye movements.  <p>

<p>

Luminance was manipulated using a neutral density filter and the glare source consisted of six
halogen bulbs that surrounded the stimulus.  It was hypothesized that contrast sensitivity would
be lowest in the condition with the greatest number of stressors, but it was not known if the
stressors' effects would be interactive.  Lowering luminance decreased contrast sensitivity by
.27 log unit; adding the glare source further reduced contrast sensitivity by .28 log unit. 
Alcohol consumption and stimulus motion decreased contrast sensitivity by .16 and .10 log
unit, respectively.  All variables had interactive effects and decrements increased as spatial
frequency increased.  <p>

<p>

The combined stressors effect was to decrease contrast sensitivity by 0.79 log unit,
corresponding to 6.2 times more contrast necessary to reach threshold.  Thus, the reduction or
elimination of these effects should be of high priority in situations where optimal contrast
sensitivity performance is desired. No useful relationships (for the drinker) were found
between objective and subjective indices of intoxication.  Further, subjective indices were not
correlated positively with the alcohol-related loss in contrast sensitivity, although BAC was
(r+.71).  Subjective indices should not be used to predict BAC or alcohol related loss in
contrast sensitivity.  Dark focus values were unrelated to visual performance.<p>

Contrast sensitivity was measured for 12 healthy young males while sober, after ingestion of
an alcohol placebo, and after ingestion of alcohol (95% grain alcohol; mean estimated blood
alcohol level = .088%).  Observations were made for both stationary gratings and gratings
that traveled through a circular path and required pursuit eye movements.  The significant
alcohol-related reduction in contrast sensitivity was 2.6 times greater for moving (.29-log-unit
reduction) than for stationary gratings (.11-log-unit reduction).  The loss in contrast sensitivity
for the moving gratings of high spatial frequency (12 cpd) was particularly severe (.37 log
unit).  Estimated blood alcohol level was correlated with the loss in contrast sensitivity for
moving gratings (r=.61), but not with the loss for stationary gratings.  Estimated blood
alcohol level was strongly correlated with the difference between the loss in contrast sensitivity
to moving and stationary gratings (r=.75).  These results are consistent with reports that
alcohol consumption degrades the ability to make pursuit eye movements.  Subjects' perceived
intoxication level was not a reliable predictor of any index of visual performance. <p>

No author's abstract or summary given.  Fairly extensive review of history and issues in vision
screening for driver licensure.  Addresses issues of testing and setting of standards, and
policies for possible restriction of driving privileges, rather than only pass/fail testing. 
Suggests screening and standards for acuity (using current methods) and visual field (using
white object on dark background), and research on dynamic acuity testing and glare
susceptibility and night driving issues (including contrast sensitivity). States that "for these
three aspects of vision [dynamic visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, glare sensitivity], there is
presently insufficient information to justify any particular standard for license denial." (p.316)<p>

Abstract:<p>

<p>

Since there is little experimental evidence on the influence of various stimulus factors on
vernier acuity, functions relating vernier acuity to illumination have been obtained for two
different exposure times and at three regions of the visible spectrum.  An apparatus providing
the necessary stimulus controls has been described in detail and the procedure is fully
explained.<p>

<p>

Vernier acuity, as measured by the reciprocal of the standard deviation of "alignment"
setting, varies with illumination for both indefinitely long and for short exposures.  At low
brightness vernier acuity is low, rises rapidly with increase in illumination, and finally levels
off at a constant level at high brightnesses.<p>

<p>

Vernier acuity functions for short exposures are displaced downward and along the
illumination axis relative to the function for long exposures.  Thus maximum vernier acuity is
never so high for short exposures and the maximum is reached at higher illuminations than
with long exposures. <p>

<p>

The relationship between vernier acuity and illumination for both long and short exposures is
fitted by Hecht and Mintz's theoretical equation for visual acuity based on the brightness
discrimination of the eye.<p>

<p>

Variations in the functions with duration of exposure of the acuity object are interpreted in the
light of the intensity-time relationship and the findings of Graham and Kemp on the effect of
exposure time on brightness discrimination.<p>

<p>

To investigate the influence of wave-length on vernier acuity, acuity <i>vs</i>. illumination functions
have been found for red, yellow, blue, and white light.  The experiments were carried out on
two different apparatus.<p>

<p>

The two sets of data obtained on the two apparatus show that all the functions are of the same
shape, but that slightly different maximum acuities are reached with the different colored
illuminations.  Red gives the highest acuity, yellow next, white next, and blue least.  When
refractive correction is made to allow for sharp focusing in blue illumination, the highest
acuities are found with this color.<p>

<p>

It was concluded that wave-length of illumination is of some significance in vernier acuity,
since higher acuities are found with nearly monochromatic light than with white.  This
improvement is perhaps caused by reduction of blurring of retinal images by restriction of the
range of wave-lengths.<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

Compare to Craik.  Similar curves obtained, with asymptote above which increasing
"illumination" did not increase acuity.  Author states she cannot explain the order of acuities
among colors tested in second experiment.<p>

Abstract:<p>

<p>

The useful field of view is defined as the visual area in which information can be acquired
within one eye fixation.  We studied visual search within this context and found a reduction in
the size of the field of as a function of age.  This loss, however, was recovered partially with
practice.  Standard acuity and perimetric tests of visual field, although diagnostic of disease,
underestimated the degree of difficulty experienced by visually healthy older adults in
everyday activities requiring the use of peripheral vision.  To aid in predicting such
performance, a model incorporating the effects of distractors and secondary task demands was
developed.<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

Subjects responded to dual tasks, one central, one peripheral (10 to 30 from fixation).  Most
interesting finding was a practice effect, where performance improved on peripheral task after
practice, and improvement persisted six months post-training.  If confirmed and extended to
performance on clearly driving-related tasks, this could have implications for testing and
licensing.<p>

Most older adults rely on the automobile to maintain their mobility and independence, in spite
of the fact that age-related behavioral and biomedical changes may make driving more
difficult.  Indeed, accident and fatality rates begin to rise after age 55.  One research goal,
therefore, is to identify functional measures that differentiate older adults who drive safely
from those who do not.  This paper discusses conceptual and methodological issues involved in
addressing this question, considers why earlier research has been largely unsuccessful, presents
a working model for approaching the problem, and argues the need for large-sample,
prospective research in this area.<p>

As a society, we have the responsibility of continuing to meet the transportation needs of a
growing population of older adults.  Simultaneously, we must recognize that driving is the
preferred mode of travel among older citizens and that the ability to drive provides the
mobility that many older adults rely on to maintain their independence.  Although some older
adults experience changes that make driving more difficult in later life, most older drivers
retain their driving competence.  With highly publicized accidents involving older drivers,
however, the issue of age as a risk factor has received considerable publicity.  Therefore,
recent research has focused on isolating risk factors with this population.  These studies have
indicated that a measure of visual attention, the Useful Field of View, is particularly promising
as a functional measure of driving risk.  Furthermore, research has shown that the Useful
Field of View can be expanded with training.  These findings have important implications for
developing interventions that might aid in maintaining the skills needed to drive safely into
older age.<p>

Driver fatigue is well recognized as an important  causational factor in accidents  involving
long-distance truck drivers.  Drivers may drive while fatigued for a variety of reasons. 
Important among these is the assignment of difficult or un reasonable delivery schedules. 
Using self-reported data, the frequency of violation-inducing  schedules is estimated during
their ongoing movement for a sample of 498 long-distance drivers.  Assuming average legal
speed limits of 55 MPH, 26% of the drivers were found to have violation-inducing schedules. 
Solo  drivers, drivers hauling refrigerated loads, regular route drivers, and those with longer
current trip distances are the most likely to have such schedules.  Also estimated were total
weekly work hours.  Assuming average attained traveling speeds of 50 MPH, the average
driver drives 46 hours per week and works a total of 58 hours.<p>

Safety on the highways is always a leading concern of the trucking industry.  This report
provides analyses and detailed results of the third RCCC Motor Carrier Safety Survey.  In
September 1988, 878 interviews were conducted with over-the-road truck drivers from the
U.S. and Canada.  These were the principal issues addressed:  perceived speed limits, truck
cruising speeds and compliance behavior; extent of driver training; extent of and truck drivers'
opinions regarding drug and alcohol usage and testing; driver financial well-being, job
intentions and employment alternatives; effectiveness of roadside inspections; role of driver
fatigue in safety; off-Interstate access for larger combination rigs; acceptance and usage of
certain safety devices (seat belts, antilock brakes, monitoring devices) and extent of radar
detector usage.<p>

<p>

<b>Drivers (pp. 3-5).</b>  Average age, 41; average years of driving experience, 15.7.  Average
grade in school completed, 12, 52% completed high school; 18% completed at least one year
of college.  Ten percent belong to unions.  For-hire carriers employ 52%, 27% are owner-operating under trip or permanent leases.<p>

<p>

<b>Equipment (pp. 5-8).</b>  Of the tractors in the 1988 Survey 52% are conventional (44% in the
1987 Survey); model years for 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987 have progressively higher
percentages of conventional tractors compared to cab-over-engine tractors.  Single dry vans
and single refrigerated vans account for 49% and 28% of all trailers, respectively.  Single
trailers 48 feet in length account for 57%.<p>

<p>

<b>Speed (pp. 10-13).  </b>Driver opposition to the 55mph speed limit approaches universality. 
Safety improved due to the 65 mph speed limit according to 59% of the drivers:  10% hold the
opposite view.  Rightly or wrongly, the large majority of truckers see the move to higher
speed limits as both appropriate and safe.<p>

<p>

<b>Driver Training (pp. 13-19).</b>  Thirty percent received formal training; the least experienced
are most likely to have had formal truck driver training.  Where did they get trained?  Private
driver training schools:  51%; trained by companies that employed them:  28%; military: 
21%.  Surprisingly, it appears that drivers with formal training are somewhat more likely to
have had accidents; the presence of formal training is not, in itself, indicative of a safer driver. 
There is a need for establishing and maintaining high standards so that drivers are taught
accident-reducing skills, rather than given a false sense of security by just having had formal
training.<b><p>

<p>

Drug and Alcohol Testing and usage (pp.19-26).</b>  Drivers were asked for the percentage of
their fellow drivers who <b>regularly</b> drive under the influence of <b>illegal</b> drugs.  The mean
response was 29%.  Marijuana, "speed" and cocaine/"crack" were the most common illegal
drugs used in the opinion of the respondents.  Forty-three percent of the drivers indicate they
have been tested for alcohol, up from 33% in 1987.  Fifty percent had undergone drug testing,
up from 38% in 1987.  Support for mandatory random drug and alcohol testing among drivers
remains high in 1988 (68%), albeit lower than in 1987 (73%).<p>

<p>

<b>Roadside Inspections (pp. 26-32).</b>  Median number of inspections per year:  3; 87% of the
respondents have had at least one yearly inspection.  Median delay per inspection:  20 and 30
minutes.  Most truckers have favorable impressions of roadside inspections.  When asked to
rate on a scale with 10 as best, the average response on fairness is 7.0 and the average 6.9 on
ability to get bad rigs off the road.<p>

<p>

<b>Driver Fatigue in Accidents (pp. 32-38).</b>  The average respondent claims that he/she can
drive 10.6 hours before requiring an extended rest; 30% indicate that they can drive longer
than 16 hours.  Drivers estimate, on average, that 36% of truck accidents are due to driver
fatigue.  What to do about the driver fatigue problem?  One third of the drivers indicate the
need for greater (explicit) controls on those dictating the schedules -- the dispatchers, shippers,
and receivers.  Increased enforcement was the second most mentioned solution (16%).<b><p>

<p>

Driver Shortage (pp. 39-45).</b>  Will drivers still be driving in 5 years?  Just under one third
indicate that they will not, with drivers over 50 years old nearly twice as likely as younger
drivers to express such feelings.  Reasons for leaving by those under age 50: 41% mention
stress- and anxiety-related factors -- such as danger and tight schedules -- and being away from
families at length; 27% say poor incomes; 21% mention stress from government agencies.  To
what occupations will they go?  21% to trucking-related occupations, like mechanic or
dispatcher; 24% into other manual work professions such as carpentry, construction, and
operating other types of vehicles; 19% say they'll be self-employed or in farming.<p>

<p>

<b>Off-Interstate Access (pp. 47-48).</b>  Just over one fifth of the drivers report at some time
having pulled "twins."  Of these drivers, over the past year, 15% pulled "twins" on roadways
where they were not legal.  Over four times as many truckers have at some time pulled 48-foot
trailers compared to truckers who have pulled "twins."  Of those with 48-footer experience,
almost one third resort to driving on nondesignated roads.  Georgia is the state that's most
problematic about access.<b><p>

<p>

Safety and Monitoring Devices (pp. 49-51).</b>  <u>Seat Belts</u>:  Two fifths almost never use their
seat belts and two fifths almost always use theirs; 34% favor a mandatory seat belt law and
53% are opposed.  <u>Antilock Brakes</u>:  77% believe they have had some experience driving rigs
with antilock braking systems.  Of all drivers, 47% feel that antilock systems are safer than
conventional braking systems; 24% are unsure or feel the systems are comparable; and 29%
believe that conventional brakes are safer.  Two thirds would oppose a law mandating the use
of antilock systems on new rigs.  <u>Radar detectors</u>:  62% of the drivers interviewed use radar
detectors themselves, and the average respondent feels that 84% of all truck drivers use them;
94% of the respondents oppose a nationwide ban on radar detectors.  <u>On-board monitors</u>: 
12% of the respondents indicate that the tractor they were driving had an on-board monitoring
device.  Do drivers think that the mandatory installation of speed-and-driving-time-monitoring
devices would improve safety?  While only 28 percent say "Yes," 54% of those with
monitoring devices say "Yes."  Unlike a ban on radar detectors, most drivers are not
philosophically opposed to a law requiring monitoring devices.<p>

Results from 3 experiments with 27 18-56 yr olds indicate a relationship between peripheral
visual acuity and search performance. It is suggested that use of this relationship can be made
in assessing the relative extent of an individual's peripheral visual field (visual lobe) for target
detection when visually screening them for industrial inspection tasks. A card sorting task
involving visual search was developed that was shown to be sensitive to S differences in search
speed. Speed of search correlated significantly with visual lobe area, but Ss' foveal acuities
were not significantly related to search time. Test-retest reliability for Forms A and B of the
card sorting task over a 1-wk period was   r  = .81 ( p  &lt; .001).<p>

Our dependence on seeing is a fact of everyday life; persons with superior visual function will
typically perform better on visual tests.  These relations, which clearly hold for the extremes
of vision, are widely supported both anecdotally and in the literature, but the extent of
relationship is not always well defined.  The three military services have active research efforts
to study whether visual test scores are related to operational performance.  The number of
visual tests available for study is very large, a need exists to summarize this information, and
to synthesize the schematic literature and other findings for application to military jobs.  As a
first step in this endeavor we selected five visual functions that we believe are not only
important for military performance but also, properly implemented, could be used to select or
classify persons so that improved operational performance could be expected and better
allocation made of the human resources.  Initially we had considered reviewing only contrast
sensitivity in Phase I, but decided that a better choice would be to delay that review until
Phase II and to cover several areas in Phase I that are less well known and perhaps not as
actively studied within Army laboratories but which, in our opinion, show good promise for
being predictive of operational performance.  Throughout our reviews we attended to the
practical issues of testing large numbers of individuals reliably, accurately, and quickly, and
included sections in our reviews describing the apparatus to be employed.<p>

<p>

In Phase II we propose two different activities to be conducted in parallel: 1) to complete our
taxonomy of visual processes and visual tests, and to produce a handbook which reviews all
this material; and 2) to conduct formal analyses of the visual functions and processes which
comprise disparate military jobs.  The handbook would contain cross-referencing of all tests to
the visual requirements of the various jobs.  It is expected that the handbook will take two
years to complete, and the final report will contain 25-40 in-depth reviews according to the
number of visual processes surveyed.  Each of these reviews would be the product of a
nationally recognized authority, although all reviews will be carefully edited and rewritten by
the Essex key personnel to assure consistency in content, style and format.  A publisher has
expressed strong interest in production and distribution of the work provided the materials can
be "civilianized" to broaden the interest for commercial markets.  Essex has agreed to
underwrite the necessary costs of transliterating the Phase II final report into a handbook that
civilian vision and eye care professional would find useful.<p>

1.  It was found that an occipital evoked potential can be elicited in the human by moving a
grating pattern without changing the mean light flux entering the eye.  Prolonged viewing of a
high contrast grating reduces the amplitude of the potential evoked by a low contrast grating.<p>

<p>

2.  This adaptation to a grating was studied psychophysically by determining the contrast
threshold before and after adaptation.  There is a temporary fivefold rise in contrast threshold
after exposure to a high contrast grating of the same orientation and spatial frequency.<p>

<p>

3.  By determining the rise of threshold over a range of spatial frequency for a number of
adapting frequencies it was found that the threshold elevation is limited to a spectrum of
frequencies with a bandwidth of just over an octave at half amplitude, centered on the adapting
frequency.<p>

<p>

4.  The amplitude of the effect and its bandwidth are very similar for adapting spatial
frequencies between 3 c/deg. and 14 c/deg.  At higher frequencies the bandwidth is slightly
narrower.  For lower adapting frequencies the peak of the effect stays at 3 c/deg.<p>

<p>

5.  These and other findings suggest that the human visual system may possess neurones
selectively sensitive to spatial frequency and size.  The orientational selectivity and the
interocular transfer of the adaptation effect implicated the visual cortex as the site of these
neurones.<p>

<p>

6.  This neural system may play an essential preliminary role in the recognition of complex
images and generalization for magnification.<p>

Abstract:<p>

<p>

Studying binocular vergence in relation to luminance levels, we isolated two types of
behaviour which may explain differences in distance appreciation:<p>

	<p>

	1.  Underestimation of distances in subjects with overconvergence in darkness.<p>

	2.  Overestimation of distances in subjects with underconvergence in darkness.<p>

	<p>

Progression towards the limiting value of convergence varies from one individual to another
for each mesopic and scotopic luminance level and for different experimental conditions: 
variable discrepancy between the observation distance and the tonic vergence distance,
accommodative or fusional stimuli at varying degrees of eccentricity, mobile stimuli in the
observer's peripheral field.  The study of bipartition in depth of a given interval for different
observation distances confirms the existence of two major categories of individuals.  Over- or
underestimation of the nearer subjective half correlates to the binocular dark convergence
capacity of each individual.  These findings may explain errors in distance appreciation for
road users in night vision.<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

Part of driving-related research program whose goals include determining "the spatial behavior
of road users at night."  Found considerable individual differences in convergence in darkness,
associated with differences in depth and distance judgements.  This work is related to the body
of work on dark focus by Leibowitz and Owens.<p>

Summary: The visual tasks of future fighter aircrew are likely to increase both in magnitude
and complexity.  The increasing adoption of devices for visual enhancement and protection,
even now, poses problems of integration with spectacles.<p>

<p>

The visual standards required for initial selection for training as a pilot or navigator should, if
numbers permit, be such that trained aircrew are unlikely to require a visual aid until
presbyopia physiologically demands correction in the latter half of the fourth decade.<p>

<p>

This paper will discuss the visual standards considered apposite for future fighter aircrew and
the related ocular examination techniques both conventional and those designed to test such
specialized ocular functions as stereopsis, glare resistance, dark adaptation, hue discrimination
and modulation transfer function.<p>

Abstract:<p>

<p>

A simulated driving task that required the simultaneous execution of two continuous visual
tasks was administered to 12 healthy young (mean age 26.1 years) and 12 healthy older (mean
age 64.4 years) experienced and currently active drivers.  The first task was a compensatory
lane-tracking task involving a three-dimensional road display.  The second task was a timed,
self-paced visual analysis task, involving either a vocal or manual binary response to dot
patterns projected within the road display.  Using adaptive tasks, single-task difficulty was
individually adjusted for each subject.  To control for individual differences in attention
allocation  strategy, the dual task was performed according to three different sets of
instructions based on the relative importance of each task.  Compared with young adults, older
adults showed a significantly decreased ability to divide attention.  This effect was apparent in
lane tracking and in the accuracy of visual analysis.  The impairment of divided attention was
less pronounced in the vocal condition than in the manual one.  This suggests that difficulty in
integrating responses may be an important determinant of poor dual-task performance in old
age.<p>

To provide driver licensing administrators with heretofore unavailable information on which to
establish effective vision-screening procedures  for driver license applicants, a number of
visual performance, personal, and driving habit characteristics of some 17,500 volunteer
California driver license applicants were compared with their 3-year driving records (accidents
and convictions).  The vision tests included those for dynamic visual acuity, static visual
acuity, field of vision, lateral phoria, low-illumination vision, glare recovery, and sighting
dominance.  Of these, dynamic visual acuity was most closely and consistently correlated with
driving record, followed by static acuity, field of vision, and glare recovery.  All relationships
were in the "expected" direction, i.e., poor vision was associated with poor record.  As
expected, among all variables studied, age, sex, and average annual mileage play the largest
role in influencing driving record.  Accident and conviction frequencies increase with
increasing mileage, are lower for females than for males, and are highest for the young age
groups.  Accident and conviction rates per 100,000 vehicle-miles decrease slightly with
increasing mileage, are approximately the same for both sexes, and are highest for young
drivers having the lowest rates.  The report gives recommendations for additional research and
suggests practical applications of the present findings.<p>

<p>

The Institute of Transportation and Traffic Engineering at UCLA has for a number of years
been conducting research on human factors in transportation.  Within this general area
considerable activity has been directed toward studying the visual requirements of the driving
task.  The California Department of Motor Vehicles, because of its responsibility for selecting
individuals who should be licensed to drive a motor vehicle, also has a strong interest in
knowing the visual requirements of driving, so that a more valid and reliable vision-screening
procedure might be used.<p>

<p>

It is not surprising, then, to find the Institute and the Department cooperating in a joint
research venture whose purpose is to determine whether relationships can be found between
how well a person sees and how well he drives, as reflected in his driving record.  The U.S.
Public Health Service is supporting a three-year research program to study the relationship
between vision test scores and driving record.  A preliminary report (1) presents a detailed
description of the study as well as of the background research leading to it.  The purpose of
the present paper is to outline the general nature of the research program and to  present the
results obtained thus far from preliminary data analyses.<p>

The perception of the apparent frequency of rotation of gratings of various spatial-frequencies
and contrast is investigated.  Increasing the spatial-frequency from 1 to 4 c/deg increases the
perceived frequency of rotation.  For higher spatial-frequencies, up to the limit of visibility,
the perceived frequency of rotation decreases in inverse proportion to the spatial-frequency. 
At low contrast, near threshold, gratings are perceived to rotate very slowly and can actually
appear to be stationary, hence the term "stopped motion".  Above a contrast level of 0.05 the
effects of contrast saturate, so that the apparent frequency of rotation equals the true frequency
of rotation.  If a rotating grating viewed by central vision is compared with an identical grating
falling on the periphery of the visual field the latter is seen to rotate very much more slowly
and indeed may appear to be stationary.  If a rotating pattern consisting of small, randomly
sited spots is compared with a similar target of large spots, the former is seen to rotate more
slowly; the same being true for targets with only one spot thereon, providing they differ in
size.  Qualitative observations using gratings moving linearly appear to be as above.  High
spatial-frequency and low contrast gratings appear to move slower.  Likewise an oscilloscope
spot oscillating back and forth at a constant velocity appears to have a lower velocity in the
peripheral field.<p>

2.  Contrast thresholds for the detection of gratings whose luminance profiles are sine, square,
rectangular or saw-tooth waves can be simply related using Fourier theory.<p>

<p>

3.  Over a wide range of spatial frequencies the contrast threshold of a grating is determined
only by the amplitude of the fundamental Fourier component of its wave form.<p>

<p>

4.  Gratings of complex wave form cannot be distinguished from sinewave gratings until their
contrast has been raised to a level at which the higher harmonic components reach their
independent threshold.<p>

<p>

5.  These findings can be explained by the existence within the nervous system of linearly
operating independent mechanisms selectively sensitive to limited ranges of spatial frequencies.<p>

Spectral dark adaptation as a function of retinal meridian and of eccentricity was investigated
by testing the absolute threshold dark adaptation curves for eight human volunteers at two
retinal meridians.  The horizontal and vertical meridians separately and together at
eccentricities of 2 degrees and 16 degrees from a fixation point were studied.  A
microprocessor-operated dark adaptometer was used, and analysis of variance was performed
on the data.  The study indicated that meridian differences in the dark-adapted retina exist and
that the horizontal meridian is more sensitive than the vertical meridian when the retina is
tested at 16 degrees with medium wavelength light.  This may indicate meridian differences in
photoreceptor distribution.<p>

Previous studies on the visual origin of time to collision (TC) information have demonstrated
that TC estimates can be based solely on the processing of target expansion rate (optic variable
).  But in the simulated situations used (film clips), there was little reliable information on
speed (owing to reduced peripheral vision) and distance (owing to the absence of binocular
distance cues) available.  In order to determine whether these kinds of information are also
taken into account, it is necessary to take an approach where the subject receives a more
complete visual input.  Thus an experiment conducted on a circuit under actual driving
conditions is reported.  Experienced drivers and beginners, who were passengers in a car, had
to indicate the moment they expected a collision with a stationary obstacle to take place. 
Subjects were blindfolded after a viewing time of 3 s.  The conditions for speed evaluation,
(normal vs. restricted visual field) and distance evaluation (binocular vs. monocular vision) by
subjects were varied.  The approach speed (30 and 90 km h-1) and actual TC (3 and 6 s) were
also varied.  The results show that accuracy of TC estimation increased with (I) normal visual
field, (ii) binocular vision, (iii) higher speeds, and (iv) driving experience.  These findings
have been interpreted as indicating that both speed and distance information are taken into
account in TC estimation.  They suggest furthermore that these two kinds of information may
be used differently depending on the skill level of the subject.  The results are discussed in
terms of the complementarity of the various potentially usable visual means of obtaining TC
information.<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

All subjects under all conditions underestimated time to collision.  Binocular vision improved
accuracy of estimation only at  lower speeds, (confounded here with distance to target) where
estimation was worst.  Speed effect not found under normal visual conditions.<p>

Experiments are described in which the monocular, steady-state, accommodation response to
sinusoidal grating targets was assessed as a function of the spatial frequency of the grating and
its vergence at the eye, using a laser optometer.  At all levels of stimulus, the response is
found to be dependent upon the grating frequency.  At very low spatial frequencies the
response is often substantially in error and is closely related to the accommodation exercised
by the observer when viewing an empty field.  At higher frequencies the response becomes
more accurate and its exact value is probably dependent upon the observing conditions and
upon the ocular aberrations and other properties of the observer.  Further experiments with
Snellen targets suggest that the accommodation to a target with a complex spatial frequency
spectrum cannot be predicted from a knowledge of that spectrum and of the observer's
response to its component frequencies, under the same viewing conditions.  The significance
of the findings to theories of accommodation is indicated.<p>

<p>

Thus, the problem of vision and transport has not been sufficiently investigated.  The methods
of visual function examination used in clinics, are most often traditional and not suitable for
the evaluation of a driver's professional fitness; the criteria of driving fitness being ill-founded
and contradictory.  So elaboration of ergophthalmological methods of visual function
examination and of criteria of professional fitness of transport operators is of vital importance. <p>

Quote:  Yu. Z Rozenblum proposes the following functions corresponding to a driver's tasks
be examined:  detection and recognition of objects moving in the visual field; tracking of a
moving object; prediction of point of intersection of moving and motionless objects; resolution
under conditions of poor visibility, low luminosity, and blinding light sources.<p>

Review and comment article, not experimental work.  Most references are to Russian articles,
but some to US and European, especially military work.  Valuable chiefly to show that
scientists outside US are concerned about driver testing and are concluding that it needs to be
made more task-relevant. <p>

The useful field of vision of a driver and its variation was investigated using a specially
equipped car on a highway at velocities ranging from 80 to 130 km/h.  The 22 subjects were
experienced policemen.  Their task was to detect signals mounted on the windshield and to
respond as quickly as possible.  The retinal locus of each signal was determined post hoc,
using a new method described in this paper.  The criteria for data evaluation were the rate of
detected signals and the corresponding reaction time.  The results showed that the size of the
useful field of vision was not influenced by the speed of traveling.  This finding contradicts the
postulated tunnel vision at increased speed.  However, the size of the useful field of vision
decreased when the driver deviated from the prescribed speed of traveling, driving either too
fast or too slow.  It is assumed that the resulting internal workload exhausted the drivers'
capacity and consequently caused perceptual narrowing, which is a peripheral manifestation of
central overload.  The results are discussed in terms of capacity limits in relation to the
drivers' task demands.<p>

Abstract:	Author's Introduction<p>

<p>

It was found by Mellone and Rawdon-Smith (1935, unpublished), and in a more extended
investigation by the present author (1938), that visual adaptation has a considerable effect upon
intensity discrimination.  The differential threshold was found to be lowest when tested at the
same illumination to which the eye was adapted, and to be raised considerably where these
'test' and 'adapt' illuminations were widely different.<p>

<p>

It seemed that a similar investigation of visual acuity might throw some light on the relation
between this and intensity discrimination.  A positive result was to be anticipated from the
experiments of Lythgoe (1932) in which acuity was diminished by a surrounding field, except
when that field had approximately 1/10th the brightness of the smaller field containing the test
object; for spatial and temporal proximity of an adapting field appear in general to have very
similar effects.<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

Classical work, but test conditions and measurement units are not those commonly used today. 
Curves were obtained for acuity vs. illumination, given equal adapting and test illumination
levels (negatively accelerating increase asymptoting at about 100 e.f.c), and for acuity vs.
illumination, given varying adaptation conditions (inverted u-shape curves, with best acuity
near adapting illumination except at very low adapting levels). <p>

Unit of illumination, e.f.c., appears to be "equivalent foot candles" (p.256).<p>

Abstract:<p>

<p>

The objectives of the project were to reassess the adequacy of the current Federal vision
standards for CMV operators (49, CFR, 391.41(b) (10), 1985).  The technical approach
included doing a critical review of existing literature; providing a preliminary draft of
recommendations; preparing a risk assessment of visual criterion levels proposed; conducting a
workshop to review draft recommendations with expert industry and vision panelists and
providing a summary of the project with final recommendation.<p>

<p>

A review and critical evaluation of the most significant scientific research, which investigated
the vision performance of passenger and commercial drivers, revealed no conclusive evidence
to support definitive changes to the current standard.  However, it was deemed important to
include visual acuity and visual fields requirements for the standard.  Based on the critical
review of the literature, opinion surveys, and workshop results collected from panelists
representing the vision industry field, the following recommendations were made:  distant
visual acuity of at least 20/40 in each eye without corrective lenses or visual acuity separately
corrected 20/40 or better with corrective lenses, distant binocular acuity of at least 20/40 in
both eyes with or without corrective lenses, field of vision of at least 120 degrees in each eye
measured separately in the horizontal meridian, and the ability to respond safely and
effectively to colors of traffic signals and devices showing standard red, green, and amber. 
No test for color vision is required.  The instructions to perform and record the visual
examination were extensively revised.  Identification of the type of equipment, the stimuli
needed to conduct the testing, and instructions on how to perform the tests were added.  The
full description of the definition and testing procedures of the standard is provided in the body
of the report.  In addition, revisions were made to the list of visual disorders and impairments
to be noted on the exam form.<p>

Abstract:	<p>

<p>

Authors' introduction: The sensation of self-motion is a common visual illusion which allows
inferences concerning visual-vestibular interaction.  It may be perceived while gazing at
moving clouds, streaming water, or when a train moves on the adjacent track in a railway
station.  This compelling sensation of body movement can even affect postural balance.  On
first approaching the problem, a psychologic explanation could be suggested in the sense of
Helmholtz's (1896) <i>Urteilst&auml;uschung</i>.  One might assume that these illusions are inferences
based upon the conscious or unconscious assumption of a stable environment, so that when the
environment does in fact move, the observer infers that he himself is moving.  This
interpretation would be consistent with the individual's past experience as the entire visual
surround seldom moves uniformly under natural conditions unless the body moves relative to
the earth.<p>

<p>

However, as in the case of other illusions, physiologic explanations may be more rewarding
than psychologic ones.  As Purkinje suggested, visual illusions reveal the truth about the visual
system (<i>Gesichtst&auml;uschungen sin Sinneswahrheiten</i>).  An analysis consistent with his view
takes into account that in the visually induced perception of self-motion, the term illusion only
applies to the case in which the surround moves exclusively, and recognizes that identical
visual stimulation occurs during actual body motion in which instance the same physiologic
mechanism may maintain the veridical perception of body motion at constant velocity.  The
assumption of such a mechanism of visual-vestibular interaction, common to both illusion and
veridicality, may lead to a better understanding of sensory control of body movement and
spatial orientation than the psychologic explanation.<p>

Under natural conditions with the eyes open, active as well as passive body motion is
adequately perceived, be it of constant or varying velocity (Fig. 1 B).  While riding in a
vehicle with the eyes closed, however, the deficiencies of the vestibular system become
apparent.  Vestibular information about motion then is evoked only through acceleration or
deceleration and dies out as the cupulae within the semicircular canals, or the otoliths,
progressively return to their resting position during constant velocity.  Consequently, constant
velocity in the dark cannot be discriminated from rest for any extended period of time.  Due to
this lack of sustained labyrinthine information about constant velocity, deceleration from
constant velocity is misinterpreted as acceleration in the opposite direction (Fig. 1 A).  These
two observations support the assumption that visual inputs are directly integrated with
vestibular afferents.  If so, the visual responses overcome the vestibular organ's deficiency for
constant velocity discrimination.  Such a concept might also entail inborn neuronal networks
for visual-vestibular interaction rather than solely experience and learning.  Thus, the
aforementioned illusion (see also Fig. 1 C) may in fact indicate a functionally important
mechanism of multisensory interaction.<p>

<p>

This chapter follows this line of reasoning.  First, psychophysic evidence is presented
indicating that motion-vision plays a predominant role not only in the perception of self-motion
but much more generally, in dynamic spatial orientation and postural control.  It will become
apparent from this that visual and vestibular information must converge on the same locus
somewhere in the brain where they are integrated to provide the basis for a unitary model of
dynamic and static orientation in space.  Second, neurophysiologic experiments, most of which
were designed to test this postulate, are discussed.  The results demonstrate the existence of at
least one site of interaction within the central nervous system which is common to all
vertebrate species tested so far: the vestibular nuclei.<p>

<p>

In order to discuss the psychophysical evidence, it is necessary to first describe the various
sorts of subjective localization and motion perception with their related reference systems, as
well as the terminology. <p>

Seven groups of 10 subjects each were exposed to various combinations of left and right head
and eye rotations for a period of 10 min.  Both head and eye produced significant aftereffects
of prior position as measured by pointing at a visible target with the unseen hand, but there
was no significant interaction.  Thus, aftereffects of sustained head and eye rotation were
shown to be additive and to account fully for the results of Craske and Crawshaw (1975).  Eye
muscle potentiation rather than recalibration may be assumed to be the cause of the altered
direction of gaze resulting from exposure to displacing prisms.<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

Argues that muscular potentiation resulting from sustained eye or head rotation can account for
observed aftereffects on visual localization.  This is in opposition to theory of "recalibration"
to account for same observed effects.  <p>

Maintaining binocular fixation on a target at 20 cm in the <i>absence</i> of secondary cues to
distance produced changes in apparent distance and lateral phoria.  Positive lenses of 0, .5,
2.0, 3.5, and 5.0 spherical diopters (SD) were used to manipulate the level of accommodative
convergence in force during the period of maintained fixation.  An inverse relationship was
found between the stimulus to accommodation and the magnitude of the induced esophoria, the
phoria being linearly related to an increase in apparent distance.  The distance aftereffect
obtained in the condition with the lowest net accommodative stimulus (i.e., 0 D) equaled that
typically produced by based-out prism adaptation with full secondary cues to distance
available.  In a second experiment, subjects walked through a well-lit hallway while viewing
through a pair of 5 base-out prisms.  It was shown that increasing the stimulus to
accommodation by adding negative lenses of 0, 1.5, 3.5, and 5.5 SD reduced the adaptive
change in apparent distance, as well as the change in phoria produced by the conventional
base-out prism adaptation paradigm.  It was concluded that a change in the resting tonus of the
disparity vergence system underlies such adaptation, rather than recalibration of the
oculomotor cues to distance.  Monocular exposure data indicated that a small change in the
tonus control for the accommodative system may be present as well.<p>

The conventional formulation of the hypothesis of relational determination asserts that the
perceived relative velocities of two or more objects depend upon their relative rates of
displacement with respect to stationary referents in the visual field.  Experiment 1 showed that
this formulation is too restrictive by demonstrating the transposition-of-velocity effect under
conditions in which two light spots moved in the absence of static visible contours and
traversed unequal path lengths.  Experiment 2 showed that angular velocity per unit of relative
angular extent, and not relative linear or perceived extent, of the respective motion paths
influences perceived relative velocity in nonarticulated space.  The retinal dimensions of static
visible frameworks were shown in experiment 3 to influence perceived relative velocity in a
direction consistent with the conventional formulation of the relational-determination
hypothesis, but the weight of the evidence suggested a reformulation along the following lines: 
the perceived relative velocities of two objects are significantly affected by the proportions of
the retinal projections of the respective movement fields traversed by the two objects in the
same unit of time, even when the motion fields consist only of the objects' motion paths.<p>

A total of 380 randomly selected patients aged 16 to 80 years, who did not have eye disease
underwent testing for night myopia between August and October 1989 with a laser speckle
generator under both photopic and scotopic conditions.  For the first 308 subjects, the speckles
were continuously run, and for the next 72 subjects a timer was used to minimize the
accommodative stimulus.  An increase in myopia of 0.75 dioptres or more from the photopic
to the scotopic state, equivalent to a visual acuity of 20/45 or less, was considered indicative of
night myopia.  Overall, 17% of the subjects were found to have night myopia.  Of the 26
subjects aged 16 to 25 in the timer group, 38% had night myopia of 0.75 D or more, 23% had
night myopia of 1.00 D or more, and 4% had night myopia of 2.50 D, which is equivalent to
an acuity of 20/265.  The results indicate that driving in the dark could create visual
difficulties for certain younger patients that a night myopic correction would eliminate.<p>

The rationale of occupational therapy is to help individuals develop and function independently
within their environment.  The privilege of driving affords people one aspect of independence
by serving as a link for the accomplishment of other daily living tasks.  Although evidence
suggests an age related decline in the skills needed for safe driving, especially after age 55, the
clinical predictors of driving performance are relatively unknown.  This study examined the
elderly drivers' perceptions of their driving abilities, compared to their clinically tested
functional skills in the area of visual perception, and their actual in-car driving performance. 
The specific skills assessed included peripheral visual field, depth perception, color sensitivity,
static visual acuity, dynamic visual acuity, and figure-ground discrimination.  The comparisons
were examined by the chi-square and analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical procedures to
determine whether a significant difference existed among the variables.  A population sample
of 115 males, 65 years and older, were selected from an outpatient clinic at the Veteran's
Administration Hospital in Richmond, Virginia.<p>

<p>

Results indicated that clinically tested visual perception skills and actual in-car driving
performance can be predictive based on left and right peripheral vision, and brown/green color
sensitivity.  This study also indicated that people generally tend to over-rate their driving
abilities.  It is believed that a larger sample and some testing instrument changes could yield
more significant results.  Limitations of this study and ideas for future research are provided.<p>

Although individual differences between inspectors is the most significant factor in differences
in inspection performance there are no suitable selection tests. The task was analyzed to
indicate the required mental characteristics, and from this a battery of 10 selection tests was
devised. These were used with a simulated task to include the search and decision components
of inspection. Presentation was by sets of slides that contained 2, 4, or 6 fault types; slides
were classified as fault free, acceptable fault, or reject. 48 college students and 18 industrial
inspectors (mean age 34.8 yrs) participated. A multivariate analysis of covariance showed no
difference between the student and industrial Ss. The best predictor was a simplified version of
the task. Good predictive ability was obtained with the Group Embedded Figures Test; other
good predictors were lobe size and mental imagery. If these tests were not used, good
predictive ability was obtained with a subset of the WAIS, Eysenck Personality Inventory
Extraversion scale, and the Gordon Test of Visual Imagery Control.<p>

A filtering approach to understanding visual perception is shown to provide a framework for
understanding certain aspects of how we see contrast, size, and form in simple gratings and
letters as well as more complex visual illusions and portraits.  Gestalt laws of closure,
wholeness, proximity, and similarity are demonstrated using filtered images.  Complex
variations in the perceived magnitude of M&uuml;ller-Lyer illusions are well predicted from
computer data based on biological filtering.  A physics of form perception is used to relate the
detection and identification of Snellen type letters to individual contrast sensitivity functions. 
These results suggest that biologically based filtering and linear systems analysis, typified by
Fourier techniques, can provide important tools with which to probe the foundations of our
visual world.<p>

Present visual standards are generally based on the observer's ability to see small high contrast
black and white letters or symbols.  Current research shows that such vision tests are not
adequate to evaluate an individual's target detection and recognition capability over ranges of
target size and contrast used in real situations.  New vision tests are being developed that use
the observer's report of the visibility of sine-wave gratings (that look like fuzzy bars) to assess
visual capability with much more sensitivity than that of standard tests.  The new tests, called
contrast sensitivity, assess vision using the same method used to assess hearing.  Just as
hearing tests use sound intensity and temporal frequency to measure audiometric sensitivity,
contrast sensitivity tests use contrast and spatial frequency to measure visual sensitivity. 
Because standard eye charts do not change contrast, they cannot measure vision sensitivity to
any except the smallest size symbols.  The relationship between contrast sensitivity and eye
charts will be discussed using normal and abnormal vision.  Although standard eye charts are
useful to create an in-focus image in the back of the retina, contrast sensitivity techniques are
needed to measure the next physiological state that determines the observer's response to that
image.  Data are presented that reveal individual differences in contrast sensitivity among
normal observers that have definite implications for visual performance in operational
environments.  Since these differences in visual sensitivity can relate to detection and
recognition ranges, these data can then be transformed into time to perform certain tasks and
lead naturally towards visual standards being based on task performance under operational
conditions.  It is suggested that contrast sensitivity data be obtained in parallel with
conventional vision tests to begin creating visual standards that relate to observer capability
over the full range of operational environments.<p>

Contrast sensitivity was found to be better than visual acuity for predicting a pilot's ability to
detect a small, semi-isolated, air-to-ground target.  Eleven instructor pilots had their acuity
measured by both conventional and contrast sensitivity methods.  Scotopic contrast sensitivity
showed the highest correlation with slant detection range (0.83).  Conventionally determined
visual acuity proved to be a poor predictor of a pilot's ability to detect a small low contrast
target.<p>

Abstract:<p>

<p>

A distinction is drawn between long- and short-range delineation, the latter being provided to
aid the driver in tracking the roadway at night and under poor visibility conditions.  A quasi-linear describing function approach is employed to represent the driver as a sensor and
controller, and it is hypothesized that reductions in the quality of the driver's visual field will
be reflected by an increase in the level of the "remnant" (interpreted in part as visual
observation noise). <p>

<p>

Experiments were performed on a rural road, to which a variety of delineation treatments were
applied, using a vehicle that permitted the identification of driver-vehicle describing functions
as subjects negotiated the test course.  The results are generally supportive of the experimental
hypothesis, with the describing function parameters yielding evaluations of delineation
treatments that are consistent with each other and with subjective ratings of task difficulty.<p>

With a knowledge of available driving aids, the physical requirements needed to drive, the
cognitive and perceptual deficits and their relationship to driving, the therapist should be able
to make an early assessment of a client's driving potential.  Other factors such as sensation,
visual acuity, peripheral vision, distance judgment, reaction time, and spasms should not be
overlooked in the preliminary driving evaluation. <p>

<p>

Through the development of the Servo-hand control, physical requirements needed for driving
have been reached.  C-5 quadriplegic persons and other severely disabled individuals who
cannot apply adequate force to drive with conventional hand controls are thus enabled to drive.<p>

Deficiency in visually-guided behaviors is the dominant effect of rearing kittens from birth
without patterned visual stimulation of the two eyes.  Following such deprivation, form
discrimination is found relatively intact when the effects of the deficient orienting behavior are
eliminated from the testing procedure.  Recent experimental analyses implicate visual feedback
contingent upon movement in a normal environment as the condition responsible for the losses
in visually guided behavior produced by deprivation of patterned stimulation.  Using the
techniques of these experiments, the two eyes may be dissociated with respect to their ability
to control movement but not in their performance of shape discrimination.  Related research on
adaptation to optical rearrangement has shown a high degree of lability in visually-guided
behavior but only limited modifiability in perception of shape.  It is suggested that the
modification of a shape that does occur results from altered localization of its parts in space. 
The measurable modification of shape is limited by the fixedness of the pattern analyzing
system.  Certain implications for the earliest development of shape discrimination are drawn.<p>

Abstract:<p>

<p>

A systematic analysis was made of the visual and auditory requirements of automobile and
motorcycle driving which resulted in the identification of visual performance parameters that
appear important to driving but that are not currently considered in the visual screening of
driver license applicants.  These include such parameters as perception of motion, dynamic
performance of the total visual system, visual performance under low levels of illumination or
in the presence of glare, and useful peripheral vision.  The analysis did not identify similar
requirements of auditory performance.<p>

<p>

A device was designed and constructed to test performance on the new visual functions as well
as on selected conventional measures.  Performance on these tests was measured on 669
licensed California drivers and compared with past accident record.  The results show that
poor performance on several of the new vision tests is associated with poor driving record. 
Further, it was shown that some vision test scores serve as better predictors of accident
involvement than such measures as age, sex, annual mileage or other biographical variables
generally considered to be the best available predictors.<p>

<p>

It is concluded that if the results of the study are verified and cross-validated on a much larger
sample of the driving population, a basis will exist for developing and implementing a
standardized visual screening program for driver license applicants that could contribute to
improving highway safety.<p>

<p>

The contrast sensitivity approach has enjoyed much success in its recent applications to
anomalous vision.  The uses, abuses, limitations and extensions of this approach are detailed
using examples of amblyopias from acquired (organic) as well as developmental (functional)
origin.  This approach is seen to extend our assessment of visual function and to have greater
sensitivity than acuity.  We are, however, severely limited in what we can say of the
perceptual consequences using this approach for two reasons.  First, sensory thresholds are
rather special points on our sensory scale and second, they monitor a rather peripheral aspect
of visual function.<p>

Notes both usefulness of CSF testing for certain diagnostic purposes, and limitations of such
testing for assessment of visual function.   Examples of problems:  Cites evidence of
differences between threshold and supra-threshold measures.  Some impaired subjects show
elevated thresholds with near-normal supra-threshold function.  Some subjects can detect
gratings, but show anomalous vision at detected frequencies, based on report of what is seen

Abstract:<p>

<p>

Data on over 14,000 drivers from the 1967 California driver vision study have been reanalyzed
with a view to establishing their implications for driver vision standards.  For the main
analysis the sample was divided into four age groupings: under 25, 25-39, 40-54, and over 54.<p>

<p>

The most consistent result throughout the study has been the failure to find a direct relationship
between poor visual performance and high accident rates for young and middle-aged drivers. 
For the over 54 age group, Dynamic and Static Visual Acuity showed the most consistent
relationship with accident rates but for an individual driver their accident prediction value
remained very low.  A more detailed age analysis failed to define more precisely the age at
which these relationships develop.  No evidence was found to support the use of Total Visual
Field as a driver screening test.  The results for two tests of night vision were regarded as
inconclusive for the Over 54 age group.  For the same nominal standard of binocular static
visual acuity, the Ortho-Rater screener was found to fail markedly fewer drivers than the
Snellen wall chart.  The implications of varying the cut-off scores for each test were
investigated, and the suggestion made that perceptual rather than sensory tests with greater
accident predictive power would be needed before acceptable alternative screening methods
could be specified for driver licensing purposes.<p>

Abstract:<p>

<p>

A pilot program was established in California in 1982 authorizing mail renewal of driver
licenses for persons under age 70 lacking clean (accident- and conviction-free) 4-year driving
records, but showing clean 2-year records at selection.  Such drivers constitute about 14% of
California's renewal population, or about 500,000 renewees per year.  Eligible drivers whose
licenses expired in 1983 were subjects of the present study.  Half of them were randomly
assigned to a group whose members were sent offers of renewal by mail and the other half
were sent standard renewal notices requiring appearance in a field office and successful
completion of vision and traffic law tests.  Traffic accidents and convictions following the
mailout of these documents were tracked for both groups; results presented here cover a 4-year
period subsequent to mailout.  During this period (a normal license term in California), no
significant overall difference was shown between the groups with respect to subsequent
convictions or accidents.  However, significant detrimental effects on accidents were noted for
a subgroup of drivers who had experienced recent traffic violations or accidents which were
not on their records at selection.  Implications of these results are discussed.<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

Provides evidence that waiving current vision test for one or two renewal cycles may not have
much effect on accidents or convictions, although authors speculate that poorer accident
performance in age group 30-50 may involve incipient vision problems not being detected. 
This study and others in this series had very large number of subjects (hundreds of thousands).<p>

<p>

Measurements of accommodation and visual resolution were obtained at a number of
luminance levels and stimulus distances.  With reductions in luminance the eye approached a
"fixed-focus" condition of accommodation for intermediate distances, resulting in
successively larger errors in accommodation for both near and far stimuli.  The visual
resolution values were initially affected by both the luminance and distance of the stimulus. 
Subsequent measurements of resolution, following the correction of accommodative errors,
were found to be independent of the stimulus distance.  The findings are discussed with regard
to the problems of "night myopia" and variations in visual resolution with stimulus distance. <p>

Monovision has been a controversial contact lens correction modality for over 30 years.  This
paper addresses the major issues and concerns and considers them in the light of patient safety,
visual efficiency and practitioner liability.<p>

<p>

Authors' Conclusion:<p>

<p>

Information currently available indicates that monovision is an effective and reasonable
prescription for correcting presbyopia, especially in the early period.  Properly selected
patients can expect to obtain good vision for most viewing distance under most circumstances. 
Patient selection criteria must include a full profile of ocular function, personal needs and
regular activities.  Patients should be fully informed of all correction alternatives, any visual
limitations and how to exercise appropriate precautions.  An informed consent document
should be presented and explained to the patient and then signed.<p>

<p>

"Clinical tests of binocular function, important in all patients, are critical in the fitting of
monovision lenses.  With properly exercised professional judgment and appropriate clinical
screening, the safety and visual efficiency of the monovision corrected patient can be assured."<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

Looks at advantages of monovision but concentrates on discussing possible disadvantages,
impairments that might be created or exacerbated by monovision corrections.   Notes
possibility of increased glare sensitivity, effects on night driving, impairment of low contrast
sensitivity, some other effects that are possible but not well documented.<p>

The stabilized contrast-sensitivity function measured at a constant retinal velocity is tuned to a
particular spatial frequency, which is inversely related to the velocity chosen.  The Fourier
transforms of these constant-velocity passbands have the same form as retinal receptive fields
of various sizes. At low velocities, in the range of the natural drift motions of the eye, the
stabilized contrast-sensitivity function matches the normal, unstabilized result.  At higher
velocities (corresponding to motions of objects in the environment), this curve maintains the
same shape but shifts toward lower spatial frequencies.  The constant-velocity passband is
displaced across the spatio-temporal frequency domain in a manner that is almost symmetric
about the constant-velocity plane at v=2 deg/s.  Interpolating these diagonal profiles by a
suitable analytic expression, we construct the spatio-temporal threshold surface for stabilized
vision, and display its properties in terms of the usual frequency parameters; e.g., at low
spatial frequencies, the temporal response becomes nearly independent of spatial frequency,
while at low temporal frequencies, the spatial response becomes independent of temporal
frequency. <p>

<p>

Temporal acuity refers to the ability to accurately and quickly perceive events as they occur
serially over time.  Generally, audition is considered to be the most temporally acute sensory
modality, functioning primarily in the frequency domain; however, many military tasks place
strong demands on visual temporal acuity.  We argue that an insufficient understanding of
temporal factors in vision may lead to inadequate design of military man-machine systems. 
For instance, the inability to rapidly "switch" attention from one visual display to another
may be a major factor in the "human error" component.  Military Standards currently contain
specifications for visual display design which are relevant to static visual acuity, but contain no
corresponding specifications which are relevant to temporal acuity.<p>

<p>

The current paper proposes the predicate for a plan of study to be undertaken to identify the
determiners, factors or sensory channels that underline visual temporal acuity.  Specifically, a
series of tests, based on prior empirical research on temporal factors in vision, have been
implemented on a portable, lightweight computer.  These tasks can be administered to
individuals to determine:  1) the degree of their stability and reliability as psychometric indices
of temporal acuity, 2) if stable and reliable, the number of temporal "factors" or channels, 3)
their uniqueness relative to what is presently measurable and predictive of operational
performance (i.e., intelligence and visual acuity), and 4) to determine the extent to which
temporal acuity can be tested and modeled in a manner sufficiently parsimonious to permit
implementation in Military Standard 1472c.<p>

As people age, a number of visual functions such as acuity, visual field, and night vision
deteriorate.  This decline in vision is associated in part with an increase in vehicular accidents
per mile driven by the elderly.  Four age-related ocular conditions - cataract, macular
degeneration, open-angle glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy - are primarily responsible for the
decline in visual acuity and visual field in the elderly.  Few epidemiologic data are available
about these diseases, and at present they cannot be prevented.  There is need for more
information about visual decline and how it affects driving performance and for development
of pragmatic approaches for detecting and assessing the elderly driver with functional visual
deficits.<p>

Although there are well-recognized declines in visual functioning with age, their contribution
to the problems of older persons on tasks in the natural environment, including driving, are
largely unknown.  Adults ranging in age from 22-92 years were surveyed in regard to their
visual difficulties when driving and performing everyday tasks.  The visual problems of
drivers increased with age along five different visual dimensions: unexpected vehicles, vehicle
speed, dim displays, windshield problems, and sign reading.  Several of the age-related visual
problems that were reported appear to be related to the types of automobile accidents more
common among older drivers.  The study also replicated the findings from an earlier
investigation of non-driving tasks that showed visual declines with age on five dimensions:
visual processing speed, light sensitivity, dynamic vision, near vision and visual search.  These
findings indicate promising areas of research regarding the effects of visual aging on tasks in
the natural environment.<p>

Notes:<p>

Survey study, using self-report only; no direct testing of visual functions.  Findings are
generally similar to other studies of vision and aging, but should be evaluated in light of other
studies showing that self-evaluation of visual function and driving skills may not be well
correlated with objectively tested visual function and driving skills.<p>

The visibility distances for young, middle-aged, and elderly observers of four different
highway signs were compared under day and dusk lighting conditions.  No age differences
were observed.  Icon signs, however, were visible at much greater distances than were text
signs for all three age groups, a difference that was more pronounced under dusk conditions. 
There were no age differences in the comprehension of icon signs, but there was considerable
variability from one icon sign to another in the degree to which they were comprehended. 
Acuity was found to be a better predictor of the visibility distance of text signs in both day and
dusk conditions than it was of icon signs.  To the degree that they are comprehended, icon
signs appear to offer drivers of all ages almost twice as much time in which to respond to
them.<p>

We compared flying performance with the results of laboratory and airborne visual tests. 
Pilots flew high-performance, telemetry-tracked A4 and F-14 aircraft.  In the low-level task,
the index of performance was bombing accuracy; in air-to-air combat, performance was
assessed by the number of missile hits scored per hit received (win/loss ratio).  The chief
laboratory tests comprised discrimination between two speeds of a radially-expanding flow
pattern, and manual tracking of a visual target.  Airborne tests comprised visual acquisition
distance of an A4 aircraft, and visual sensitivity to a change in the course of an approaching
A4 aircraft.  We found that the flow pattern and movement-in-depth tracking test results
correlated with bombing accuracy, confirming previously reported simulator findings.  The
results of airborne visual tests correlated with the win/loss ratio in combat, and tracking test
results correlated with the number of missiles fired per combat engagement. Subsidiary test of
motion, grating contrast, and visual acuity thresholds were carried out for comparability with
other studies, but these measures did not predict flying performance.<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

Same general comments as for Kruk, Regan, et al., 1981.   This study found somewhat more

Looking for visual differences in pilots to account for differences in flying performance, we
tested five groups of subjects: Air Force primary student jet pilots, graduating (T38 aircraft)
students, Air Force pilot instructors, and two control groups made up of experienced nonpilot
aircrew and nonflying civilians.  This interim report compares 13 different visual test results
with low-visibility landing performance on the Air Force Human Resources Laboratory ASPT
simulator.  Performance was assessed by the number of crashes and by the distance of the
aircraft from the runway threshold at the time of the first visual flight correction.  Our main
finding was that, for student pilots, landing performance correlated with tracking performance
for a target that changed size (as if moving in depth) and also with tracking performance for a
target that moved sideways.  On the other hand, landing performance correlated comparatively
weakly with psychophysical thresholds for motion and contrast.  For student pilots, several of
the visual tests gave results that correlated with flying grades in T37 and T38 jet aircraft. 
Tracking tests clearly distinguished between the nonflying group and all the flying groups. On
the other hand, visual threshold tests did not distinguish between nonflying groups except for
grating contrast, which distinguished between the nonflying group and the pilot instructors. 
The sideways motion tracking task was sensitive enough to distinguish between the various
flying groups.<p>

Preliminary findings.  Useful mostly as a suggestion of predictive validity for some kinds of
vision testing, but flying differs from driving in important ways.  This whole body of research
is limited by using mostly pilots as subjects.  These subjects have high acuity and low
incidence of other visual deficits.  Lack of between-subjects variability on vision measures
restricts correlations between visual and other performance measures.  <p>

Abstract:<p>

<p>

Experimental evidence is presented that the focus of the eye tends to return passively to an
individually characteristic intermediate resting position or dark-focus whenever (1) the
stimulus to accommodation is degraded or (2) when the quality of the image is independent of
focus.  Based on measurements of the dark-focus with a laser optometer, it is possible to
predict the magnitude of night, empty field, and instrument myopia on an individual basis. 
The role of the intermediate dark-focus as a factor in accommodation also provides an
explanation for the paradoxical variation of visual acuity with observation distance. 
Applications to night myopia and night driving are described, and implications for clinical
practice are discussed.<p>

The dark focus of accommodation for an individual observer correlates highly with the
magnitude of night, empty field, and instrument myopia.   These anomalous myopias are
interpreted as resulting from the passive return of accommodation to an individually
determined intermediate dark focus when the stimulus for accommodation is degraded or
absent, or when the need for accommodation is eliminated.  <p>

<p>

This chapter discusses needs for behavioral research in transportation focusing on two diverse
areas that are representative of the broad scope of human factors.  One area, vehicular traffic
safety, draws on traditional concerns with the individual and the machine, while the second,
aviation safety, centers on team performance and training in a high technology environment. 
With regard to aviation, the definition of relevant human factors research includes components
of organizational, social and personality, educational, and cross-cultural psychology, as well as
more traditional cognitive, experimental, and engineering concerns.<p>

<p>

All forms of modern transportation--aviation, maritime, rail, space, and vehicular--involve the
interaction of individuals or groups with technology in a regulated system.  The successful
application of human factors research must reflect an understanding of systems influences on
behavior and on the acceptance of solutions.  Despite its concentration on the automobile and
one aspect of aviation, many of the research needs discussed apply equally to other forms  of
transportation, such as railroad and maritime operations.<p>

Abstract:	Author's Introduction (truncated)<p>

<p>

The first hundred years in the history of modern psychology have resulted in the development
of a number of theories.  In particular, the study of perception has been enriched by theoretical
formulations, such as those of the Gestalt psychologists and of J. J. Gibson, which have played
such an important role in the conference.  More recently, we have been introduced to
sophisticated information processing models and to the spatial frequency analysis of visual
scenes.<p>

<p>

There are many advantages to theoretical points of view.  One advantage is to suggest new and
different ways to look at phenomena.  Even though the scope of a given theory may be
limited, it suggests new "mental sets" and unique ways of approaching interesting
observations.<p>

<p>

The purpose of the present paper is to discuss a recent theoretical position that has stimulated
novel analyses and interpretations of surprisingly diverse findings.  The "two-visual systems"
concept of concern here originated with Gerald Schneider's dissertation at M.I.T. in the early
1960s in which he discovered that object recognition and spatial orientation can be selectively
impaired in the hamster by lesions of the cortex or the superior colliculus.  In 1967 Schneider,
along with Richard Held, Colwyn Trevarthen, and David Ingle, presented a symposium at the
Eastern Psychological Association meeting where they described experiments, including
studies on humans, which they interpreted in terms of the two systems concept (Held, 1968;
Ingle, 1967; Schneider, 1967; Trevarthen, 1968).  For anyone interested in the history and
early development of this problem, these works represent a prime literature source.<p>

<p>

Although the concept of two systems is derived from selective ablation studies and much of the
literature has a strong anatomical flavor, the present treatment deliberately de-emphasizes
anatomy.  This is of course not meant to minimize the ultimate importance of
neurophysiology, however.  Because the nervous system is much more complex in humans
than in the hamster and our concern is primarily with perception and behavior in humans, it
seems appropriate to follow Held's suggestion and to speak of "two modes of processing
spatially distributed information" (Held, 1970).<p>

<p>

The two modes of processing concept can best be described in functional terms.  It posits two
independent and dissociable modes of processing: (1) a "focal" mode that is in general
concerned with the question of "what" and subserves object recognition and identification; (2)
an "ambient" mode concerned with the question of "where" which mediates spatial
orientation, locomotion, and posture.<p>

<p>

In the original formulation of the two systems or modes of processing, reference was made to
two <i>visual</i> systems, but this must be modified.  Although visual information is adequate for the
focal mode, the ambient mode involves the coordination of motor activity with the visual,
vestibular, auditory and somatosensory system, particularly, kinesthesis.  In the discussion that
follows, examples of the diverse basis of the ambient mode and the importance of interaction
among its various components are described. . . <p>

Abstract:	(Authors' Introduction)<p>

<p>

The objective of the present chapter is to examine a number of problems of vehicle guidance
within the context of recent developments in psychophysics, neurophysiology, anatomy and
neurology.  The theme of this presentation is that these, like other applied problems, exist
primarily when the underlying physiological mechanisms are not well understood.  With an
increased understanding of fundamentals we can not only better appreciate the nature of
applied problems but can also frequently identify methods towards their solution.  In turn,
applied problems serve a valuable function by directing attention to gaps in our basic
understanding which leads to suggestions for fruitful areas for research.  At the same time as
we learn more about fundamentals, new application possibilities manifest themselves.<p>

<p>

The plan of the present chapter is to review selectively three areas in which recent research has
increased our understanding of fundamental mechanisms.  These are 1) the two modes of
processing concept; 2) the multisensory nature of spatial orientation; and 3) the intermediate
dark-focus of accommodation.  Space does not permit an exhaustive treatment of these topics. 
Rather, the literature will be reviewed briefly in order to provide a basis for describing the
relevance of these developments to specific problems in vehicle guidance and locomotion.  <i>By
juxtaposing basic developments and potential applications their close relationships should be
apparent, and the value of an approach which purposely de-emphasizes differences between
"basic" and "applied" science will, it is hoped, be demonstrated. </i><p>

Differences in display area, luminance, test object design, statistical validation procedures, and
contrast often generate inconsistent and/or contradictory test results.  Therefore, the author
suggests that there is an immediate need for general agreement on the critical design criteria of
these devices and on uniform test procedures.  Lempert briefly discusses NAS/NRC standards
for the assessment of visual acuity, which specify test parameters.  He asserts that the
background luminance must remain constant at all levels of contrast for contrast
acuity/sensitivity testing.  In normal eyes, at high luminance, the peak sensitivity is about 5
cycles per degree, and high-frequency cutoff occurs at approximately 60 cpd.  Contrast is
sometimes defined as the maximum deviation from the background luminance divided by the
background luminance.  While this definition is usually applied to eye charts, a difficulty with
this format is that the mean luminance decreases with optotypes that occupy a large proportion
of the total screen.  Accordingly, Lempert presents a definition of contrast in which contrast is
regarded as modulation, the ratio of the maximum change in luminance from its mean value.  <p>

<p>

Dynamic optotype presentations can help detect degradation or retinal summation mechanisms,
which is useful in selection of candidates for complex visual tasks.  Lempert asserts that
modern standards must include criteria for dynamic testing.  In addition, Lempert suggests that
an inadequate number of targets, such as a letter chart using only three letters at each contrast
or with only one optotype of each size and contrast, seriously undermines test validity. 
Finally, the author states that the recommendations of the Committee on Vision for the
Assessment of Distance Visual Acuity and the Committee's observations on contrast testing
should be the basis for new clinical contrast acuity/sensitivity systems.  <p>

The effects of target wavelength on the resolution of moving targets were investigated over a
range of target velocities under both photopic and scotopic viewing conditions.  The
wavelength of the photopically matched targets had no effect on dynamic acuity under the
bright background condition.  However, with low background luminance the wavelength of the
targets had pronounced effects, with blue targets producing far superior resolution and red
targets, the poorest resolution.  These results were maintained over both 250- and 400-ms
target durations and regardless of whether initial target position was foveal or peripheral.  The
likely contribution of the rod system to dynamic visual acuity under some conditions is
proposed, and possible implications for applied settings are discussed.<p>

Training effects on dynamic visual acuity (DVA) were determined over a range of target
durations and target velocities under the viewing conditions of free-head movement.  Dynamic
acuity levels were lower than static acuity levels, and training was found to be very effective in
improving performance, particularly under the most difficult conditions in which performance
was poorest.  Improvement was also most evident among those observers who initially
exhibited the poorest DVA scores.  Preliminary comparisons between DVA scores of a non-select sample of college students and those of a small group of college athletes indicated that
the athletes were not very different from the nonselect group and would also benefit from
training on the task.<p>

Authors raise many interesting questions about training effects:  relation to real-world visual

To elucidate the possible traffic safety risks induced by visual field defects, a method was
developed based on a driving simulator.  The capacity to detect stimuli of different size
appearing in 24 different positions of the screen in front of the driver was measured.  Two
groups of normal subjects and a number of subjects with different visual field defects were
studied.  In the groups of normals, the median reaction times were fairly homogeneous.  There
was a slight difference between central and peripheral stimuli, which was somewhat larger for
the older subjects.  Among the subjects with field defects, the individual variations were very
dominant.  Very few of these showed a capacity to compensate for their deficiency.  In order
to gain insight into possible compensatory mechanisms of these persons, eye movement
recordings were made.  The results indicate that the visual search pattern may be of
importance in this respect.  Some comparisons with respect to detection capacity were also
made with one-eyed subjects and with optically generated field restrictions (spectacles and
spectacle frames).<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

Most interesting finding is inability of most subjects to compensate for visual field defects
under these conditions.  Use of test methods that come close to duplicating real world driving
tasks may reveal functional capabilities differing from what would be assumed based on
clinical tests  (e.g., ability of some subjects to compensate for visual field defects).<p>

Visual acuity may be measured during the voluntary ocular pursuit of moving test objects. 
This visual function has been referred to as dynamic visual acuity.  The apparent movement of
the test object is produced by rotating a mirror in the desired plane of pursuit by means of a
wheel and disk type variable speed drive.  The range of angular velocities utilized is 10/ to
170/sec at the nodal point of the tested eye.  It is shown that visual acuity deteriorates
markedly and significantly as the angular velocity of the test object is increased.  It is shown
further that the relationship between visual acuity and the angular velocity of the test object
may be described satisfactorily by the semiempirical equation Y=a+bx3.  It also is pointed out
that individuals possessing similar static acuity may differ significantly in their dynamic acuity. 
The possible causes for the observed deterioration of acuity are discussed and it is concluded
that imperfect pursuit movements of the eye result in a continued motion of the image on the
retina.  This motion results in reduced intensity contrast, which is a factor in producing loss in
acuity.<p>

<p>

The question investigated was whether or not eye movements accompanied by abnormal retinal
image movements, movements that are either or both at a different rate or in a different
direction than the eye movement, predictably lead to perceived movement.  Os reported
whether or not they saw a visual target move when the movement of the target was either
dependent on and simultaneous with their eye movements or when the target movement was
independent of their eye movements.  In the main experiment, observations were made when
the ratio between eye and target movement (em/tm) was 2/5, 1/5, 1/10, 1/20, and 0.  All these
ratios were tested when the direction of the target movement was in the same (H+), opposite
(H-), and at right angles to (V+, V-) the movement of the eyes.  Eye movements, target
movements, and reports of target movement were recorded.  Results indicate that a
discrepancy between eye and target movement greater than 20% predictably leads to perceived
target movement, whereas a discrepancy of 5% or less rarely leads to perceived movement. 
The results are interpreted as support for the operation of a compensatory mechanism during
eye movement.<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

Authors clearly see results as supporting compensatory theory; also state that they do not
believe that all movement perception is suppressed during saccades.<p>

Abstract:<p>

<p>

The yes-no signal-detection task was coupled to an interactive "tracking" procedure to create a
rapid method for measuring orientation discrimination in clinical and basic research settings. 
As is the case in related physiological work, only one stimulus is presented on each trial:  No
simultaneous or successive matching is involved.  Results obtained with this method show that
orientation sensitivity for sinusoidal gratings depends on orientation (the "oblique effect") but
is independent of spatial frequency.<p>

<p>

Thirty male college students, with 20/20 vision or better, were tested under two levels of
ambient illumination and two levels of contrast.  Dynamic acuity data were then analyzed by a
randomized complete block design (2x2x30) with repeated measures.  The results indicate that
an ambient illumination-contrast combination exists where DVA is optimum.<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

Main effect of ambient illumination was highly significant, as was interaction of room by
projector illumination.  In high room illumination, higher contrast gave better performance. 
In low room illumination, it did not.  Note that authors used contrast calculation equivalent to
C=(max - min)/min; not (max - min)/(max + min).  The variations of illumination and
contrast do not seem to have been completely independent.<p>

The absolute velocity thresholds of movement were determined at 48 positions in peripheral
vision.  An aircraft-type instrument, with a standard altimeter hand, was located at random
positions on the concave, black surface of an 80-in.  Fiberglas hemisphere.  Four types of
movement were investigated (clockwise and  counter-clockwise rotation, vertical and
horizontal motion) under conditions of constant photopic lighting.  While the subject fixated on
the center point of the hemisphere, the absolute velocity threshold of each type of movement
was determined for each position using the method of limits.  Ten airline pilots served as
subjects.  The absolute threshold isograms on perimetric charts for both rotary and linear
motion are elliptical in shape, with the horizontal axis approximately twice as long as the
vertical axis.  There is no difference between a subject's ability to see clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation.  An individual's ability to perceive vertical motion is slightly better than
his ability to perceive horizontal motion in the area adjacent to the horizontal axis.  Velocity
and area swept by the instrument hand are significant factors in the perception of movement, 
but they are not similarly correlated for all types of movement.<p>

Confirms other findings that area of high sensitivity extends further in horizontal than vertical
directions from fixation point (threshold isograms were roughly elliptical). <p>

This study compared the performance of 40 monocular and 40 binocular tractor-trailer drivers
on measures of both visual and driving performance.  On the visual measures, the
mononuclear drivers were significantly deficient in contrast sensitivity, visual acuity under low
illumination and glare, and binocular depth perception.  They were not significantly deficient
in static or dynamic visual acuity, visual field of individual eye, or glare recovery.  Driving
measures of visual search, lane keeping, clearance judgment, gap judgment, hazard detection,
and information recognition showed no differences between monocular and binocular drivers. 
Monocular drives were poorer than binocular drivers only in sign reading distance in both
daytime and nighttime driving.  This decrement correlated significantly with the binocular
depth perception measure.  There were large individual differences within each group for most
of the visual and driving performance measures.  It was concluded that monocular drivers have
some significant reductions in selected visual capabilities and in certain driving functions
dependent on these abilities, compared with binocular drivers.  However, monocular drivers
are not significantly worse than binocular drivers in the safety of most day-to-day driving
functions.  Implications of these findings and the large individual differences within each
group are discussed.<p>

Abstract:<p>

<p>

The present study was an attempt to determine the effect of changing the intensity of the target
illumination on dynamic visual acuity.  The range of target velocities tested was 200/sec to
1200/sec, while the range of target intensities was 0.04 to 125.0 footcandles.  <p>

<p>

Previous studies have demonstrated that the amount of improvement in visual acuity resulting
from an increase in illumination above a level of 1.0 footcandle is negligible when the test
object is stationary.  Ludvigh has theorized that when the eye is attempting to pursue a moving
target there is frequently a velocity mismatch between the eye and target.  This mismatch
results in a reduction of the retinal intensity contrast which reduces visual acuity.  It would be
predicted then, that visual acuity would be improved by raising the illumination to higher
levels when the test object is moving.  The present study indicated that this is indeed what
happens in that if the level of illumination was raised as the angular velocity of the test object
was increased, the visual acuity did not deteriorate as rapidly as would otherwise have been
expected.  <p>

<p>

It was also found that the semi-empirical equation, y = a + bx3, which had been used
previously to describe dynamic visual acuity at a single brightness level described satisfactorily
the data obtained throughout the entire range of brightnesses examined.<p>

Abstract:<p>

<p>

It was demonstrated that the manner in which visual acuity deteriorates as the angular velocity
of the test object increases is similar regardless of whether the motion is produced by moving
the target vertically, horizontally, or by rotating the observer in a horizontal plane.  It was
shown also that the semiempirical equation Y=a+bx3 describes satisfactorily these three types
of movement.  It was pointed out that individuals having a low acuity threshold in the vertical
plane of movement will be likely also to have a low threshold in the horizontal plane.  It was
shown that although 5 to 10 footcandles may be sufficient illumination when the test object is
stationary, visual acuity is substantially benefitted by increases up to 125 foot-candles when the
observer is rotated.  This corroborates earlier findings reported by Ludvigh.<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

No test with active movement of the observer; only passive movement.  It would be interesting
to see these findings confirmed with active movement, since its total sensory input would be
different.<p>

Abstract:	Authors' Introduction<p>

<p>

This article deals with the effect on foveal visual acuity of relative motion between the test
object and the observer.  Curiously enough, this subject appears to have been investigated first
only in 1947.  However, a special case of visual acuity when the object is moving, namely, the
size threshold or minimum visible, the ability to perceive the mere presence of an object but
not its details, was discussed as early as 1937.<p>

	<p>

The classical method of testing visual acuity with the observer and test object both stationary
is, of course, almost ideal for the determination of refractive errors, but the eyes are seldom
employed under those conditions.  An exception is the remarkable task of reading, during
which task most individuals exhibit fixation pauses interspersed with saccadic movements.  On
the other hand, the eyes are frequently employed while the individual is himself walking,
riding on or in some vehicle or viewing a moving person or object.<p>

	<p>

The questions which arise concerning visual acuity when relative motion exists between the
eye and the test object are numerous.  A few of these questions are enumerated:<p>

<p>

	1.  In what manner does visual acuity deteriorate as the relative angular velocity of
the test object is increased?  Is the deterioration gradual and steady, or are there
one or more critical velocities at which visual acuity suddenly worsens?<p>

<p>

	2.  Are there marked differences between individuals in the functional relationship
between visual acuity and relative angular velocity?<p>

<p>

	3.  What is the effect of brightness, contrast, blurredness and other variables on
visual acuity when the object is moving?<p>

<p>

	4.  What is the effect on the normal individual of different types of movement in a
frontal plane, such as horizontal, vertical, oblique and circular movements, and
how does this differ in individuals with various oculomotor defects?<p>

<p>

	5.  How is the ability to discriminate detail in a moving object affected by age,
fatigue, drugs and other factors?<p>

<p>

	6.  Can this faculty be improved by training?  Does it deteriorate with lack of use?<p>

<p>

	7.  Are the results different if the observer, rather than the test object, is moved?<p>

<p>

	8.  What are the basic causes for the loss of visual acuity with increasing relative
angular velocity of the test object?<p>

	<p>

This article reviews and interprets the experimental results obtained in an effort to answer
some of these questions.<p>

Abstract:	Two experiments were conducted in an attempt to develop an open-loop technique
for assessing the influence of ocular vergence on accommodation changes.  Past research had
shown that a small point of light (1.2 mm in diameter) induces relatively small changes in
monocular accommodation at viewing distances greater than 50 cm.  However, Experiment 1
(using seven male and six female undergraduates as subjects) demonstrated that, even with a
smaller light spot (.29 mm), subjects could accommodate to the stimulus at distances closer
than 50 cm.  It was only with a very impoverished target (.08 mm diameter), as used in
Experiment 2 (in which five male and five female undergraduates served as subjects), that it
was possible to present a stimulus that could induce ocular vergence without being a direct
stimulus in itself for accommodation.  It was also shown that ocular vergence can drive
accommodation and that ocular vergence can vary systematically under conditions in which
illumination is greatly reduced.  In addition, both experiments showed significant relationships
among dark focus and both monocular and binocular accommodation.<p>

Standards for aviation personnel should be based on capacities for performing critical tasks. 
The purpose of this study was to determine whether scores on task-relevant visual tests could
be used to predict air-to-air target detection performance of pilots involved in air combat
maneuver (ACM) training.<p>

<p>

NAMRL has developed a series of automated vision tests in a mobile field laboratory located
at a Tactical Air Combat Training System (TACTS) range.  A computerized telemetry network
provides extensive real-time data on observer and target aircraft flight dynamics, and
environmental parameters.  A pilot's performance on each ACM engagement was measured by
the slant range at the instant he sighted a target aircraft.  (Slant range is the distance separating
observer and target aircraft, inclusive of altitude separation.)<p>

<p>

Preliminary analyses show that about 30% of the variance in slant range is accounted for by
flight dynamics, environmental parameters, and vision data.<p>

Threshold vernier acuity was measured under different conditions of target movement and
exposure duration.  In the case of a simple two-line vernier target, image motion up to about 3
deg/sec had little effect upon threshold for a briefly exposed (150 msec) target which is
relatively poor even for a stationary stimulus but produced a decrement in acuity for a
continuously exposed stimulus.  This finding was repeated in a second experiment which used
a centroid cue to vernier offset, and which compared the effects of horizontal and vertical
target orientation.  It is suggested that image motion and reduced exposure duration restrict the
proportion of the light spread function that can be usefully sampled by the neural networks
responsible for hyperacuity.<p>

Summary: The NAMRL Vision Test Battery provides assessment of various visual functions,
including spot detection, acuity at high and low contrast, glare sensitivity, and accommodative
flexibility.  Within these tests are measures of threshold, threshold stressed response time (for
near-threshold stimuli), and unconfounded response time (for supra-threshold stimuli).<p>

<p>

The contribution of response time variables to predicting flight performance was evaluated for
73 fighter pilots.  Vision test data were compared to performance in air combat maneuver
training.  The distance (slant range) between the observer and target aircraft at time of initial
visual detection was used as the performance variable.<p>

	<p>

Availability of response time variables enhanced the ability to predict the air-to-air visual
target detection performance of these pilots.  Four vision variables accounted for about 32% of
the variance in performance of those pilots who detected target aircraft at slant ranges greater
than the group average.  Prediction of performance is improved by incorporating other vision
data and additional refinement of the performance measure.<p>

<p>

In many everyday situations relative motion exists between human beings and the visual
information which they must acquire and resolve in order to perform their tasks successfully. 
In particular, tasks such as flying aircraft, driving automobiles and other vehicles, and
resolving moving information presented via visual displays impose a requirement on the human
operator to process moving information.  Since Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) is a critical
visual skill involved in performing such visual tasks, the present review was undertaken in
order to better understand this visual skill and to provide a basis for continuing research in this
area.<p>

<p>

Considerable research in the area of DVA has been undertaken since the review published in
1962 by Miller &amp; Ludvigh, which included DVA research performed prior to 1960.  The
present review summarizes the DVA literature and findings included in the 1962 review,
presents findings of DVA investigations reported between 1960 and 1978, and relates some of
the latter findings to the former.<p>

Abstract:<p>

<p>

The behaviors involved in driving a motor vehicle are impaired by alcohol in varying degrees. 
However, investigators have not found an absolute threshold below which there is no
impairment of any kind.  Certain skills important for driving are impaired at 0.01 to 0.02
percent BAC or, in other words, at the lowest levels that can be measured reliably. <p>

<p>

The area most critical to driving - that is, the brain's ability to observe, interpret, and process
information from the eyes and other senses - is also impaired by alcohol.  A driver cannot
operate a vehicle safely if:<p>

<p>

	*information processing is slowed<p>

	*visual perception is degraded<p>

	*ability to allocate attention to multiple sources of information limited.<p>

<p>

With these kinds of central deficits, sooner or later a driver will fail to see something that is in
the path of the vehicle - a car, a pedestrian, a fixed object - and an accident occurs.<p>

<p>

It is important to understand that crashes are not limited to drivers with high BACs.  Rather,
there is a significant risk that extends to low and moderate BACs.  Drivers need to know that
they are impaired and are at increased risk of crash when they have consumed even small
amounts of alcohol.  The safety-minded consumer will restrict alcohol use to times and places
that do not include driving.<p>

Abstract:	Summary:<p>

<p>

The primary objective of this report is to formulate test conditions, procedures, and criteria
which can serve the clinical need associated with routine ophthalmological and optometric
measurement of visual acuity.  The aim is to enable different examiners to obtain the same test
results.<p>

<p>

The major emphasis is on the standardization of so-called 'distance' acuity for distances
approximating optical infinity.  Recommendations are also made for tests at a suggested near
distance of 40 cm (16 inches).  The proposed near tests include (a) measures of acuity with
capital letters under conditions comparable to those used to measure distance acuity, and (b)
tests of ability to read continuous text.  These recommendations are summarized as follows.<p>

<p>

Standards for Assessment of Distance Acuity<p>

<p>

(1) Optotypes, to be acceptable, must be shown to be approximately equal in difficulty to the
Landolt ring.  The ten Sloan letters as a group are recommended as meeting this requirement.<p>

<p>

(2) The size are to approximate equal steps of 0.1 on a logarithmic scale, i.e., every
successively larger size is about 1.26 times the preceding one.  The horizontal spacing between
the letters on a given line is to be such that the separation between adjacent borders shall not
be less than the overall size of the letter.  The vertical separation between the borders of letters
on successive lines shall not be less than the size of the larger letters and not greater than twice
this lower limit.  When all ten letters are shown on a single line they are to be separated into
two groups of five for easier orientation.  In the case of the larger letters, space limitations
may require that there be two lines of five each.<p>

(3) The letters are to be black on a white background with a contrast not less than 0.85.  The
luminance of the white background is to be 85+/- 5 cd/m2.<p>

<p>

(4) Acuity is determined by the smallest size at which 7 of 10 (or 6 of 8) letters are correctly
identified at a given distance.<p>

<p>

(5) To anticipate the future change to the metric system, it is recommended that the testing
distance be specified in meters from the spectacle plane.  Each letter size on the chart should
be marked to show the distance, again in meters, at which the critical detail subtends a visual
angle of 1 min.  It is suggested for consideration that the standard testing distance be changed
from the generally used 20 ft to a distance of 4 m.  The arguments supporting these
recommendations are listed on pages 121-123.  The Committee proposes to review this
question again in 4 years, as discussed in the preface.<p>

<p>

(6) It is suggested that these standards be incorporated into protocols for clinical trials. 
Furthermore, so that sequential measures are not affected by memory of optotypes, it is
recommended that more than one chart or projected chart be available with different optotype
orders.<p>

Standards for Assessment of Near Acuity<p>

<p>

(1) On the basis of the specifications defined for the distance visual acuity test, the same test
characteristics can be applied with modest modifications to a near test for single capital letters. 
It is suggested for consideration that the test be conducted at 40 cm (this is consistent with a 4-meter test distance); successive lines should not be crowded too closely, and it is desirable that
pupil size be recorded and that luminance be compatible with that used at distance.<p>

<p>

(2) Many near tests require continuous sentences and paragraphs (or other suitable material). 
Certain principles for such tests are outlined on pages 127-131.  In general, the size of the
letters used in such tests may be specified in terms of the height of lower case letters such as o
and e.<p>

This report summarizes a program conducted for the Department of the Army Manpower and
Personnel Integration (MANPRINT) program and the Army Research Institute for the
Behavioral and Social Sciences, with the objective of developing a low-cost test battery for
screening soldiers for skill areas requiring high visual performance.  The method included use
of a variety of measures of visual performance (Snellen acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual
detection lobe, and other parameters) and assessing soldier detection performance against a
variety of target detection tasks.<p>

<p>

The results indicated strong correlations between target detection and contrast sensitivity (6,
12, and 18 cycles/degree) and size of the visual detection lobe (useful field of view).  Two
analytical methods were used: multiple regression against target detection time, which yielded
a multiple R of .901, and canonical correlation of all measures of visual performance against
three detection tasks, yielding a canonical correlation of .897.  Visual detection lobe diameter
(useful field of view) had a simple correlation of 0.66 with probability of detection and 0.68
with detection time.<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

This study used Army personnel who were trained observers, and whose visual performance
attributes were rather narrowly distributed compared to the general population.  This makes
the results particularly striking, and provides support for the use of contrast sensitivity and
UFOV in an improved CDL vision standard.<p>

Vision in twilight has long been of interest for both practical and theoretical reasons, and
research has profited from inquiries from both these perspectives.  Problems of twilight
myopia and nighttime traffic  accidents are presented as examples of the challenges and
potential benefits of coordinating basic and applied modes of inquiry.<p>

<p>

The accuracy of steady-state accommodation for high contrast sinusoidal gratings was
compared with the observers' contrast sensitivities for the same gratings.  Stimuli ranging in
spatial frequency from 0.5 to 19 c/deg were presented at optical distances ranging from 0 to 5
diopters, and accommodative responses were measured with a laser optometer.  Contrast
thresholds were obtained by the method of constant stimuli.  The results showed that optimal
performance for both accommodation and contrast sensitivity was obtained for spatial
frequencies of 3-5 c/deg. while progressively diminished performance was obtained for higher
and lower spatial frequencies.  The accuracy of accommodation for sinusoidal gratings of
intermediate spatial frequencies was equivalent to that for a square-wave grating of 4 c/deg. 
These findings imply that sharp edges are not necessary for accurate accommodative
responses, and they suggest that mechanisms underlying foveal contrast resolution are also
involved in the control of steady-state accommodation.<p>

Previous research has shown that ocular accommodation tends to correspond to an intermediate
distance, the <i>dark focus</i>, in the absence of effective stimulation.  The present experiments
measured accommodative responses in the presence of two adequate, monocular stimuli
superimposed optically at different distances.  In Experiment I, observers attempted to
maintain a matrix of letters in clear focus, as a superimposed mesh screen was varied in
distance.  In Experiment II, observers were instructed to focus the "easier" of two similar
grating patterns that were presented over a range of distances with a constant separation of two
diopters.  The results of both experiments showed an accommodative response bias toward
target distances near the observers' dark focus of accommodation.  The implications of these
findings for the theoretical resting state of accommodation and for practical problems of visual
performance are discussed.<p>

Two experiments were conducted in the laboratory to evaluate potential benefits of different
retroreflective markings for nighttime pedestrian visibility.  Video recordings of a jogger
wearing four different markings  were made from a vehicle in four different road
environments.  Subjects viewed composite tapes that included each of the 16 jogger
marking/road environment combinations as well as travel with no targets.  The task was to step
on a pedal immediately upon seeing a jogger, which had no effect on the flow of the video
playback.  The time between depression of the pedal and the point of "impact" was the major
dependent variable.  Experiment 1 showed that performance was better for all retroreflective
markings than for the dark control and that it was better with markings of the limbs than of the
torso.  Experiment 2, which included a secondary video tracking task, showed that
performance was better for markings that incorporate biological motion than for a vest or
arbitrarily positioned stripes on the limbs.  Questionnaire data indicated that 85% of the
subjects judged the biological motion markings to be "easiest to see."  Also, subjects reported
more conservative estimates of nighttime visibility and greater willingness to take personal
precautions at night after participating in the experiment.<p>

This paper reports a novel approach to quantitative prediction of nighttime visibility with
headlight illumination.  Unlike previous efforts to model nighttime visibility, our goal is to
provide an index of visibility that can be understood by non-specialists, as well as scientists
and engineers, as a useful approximation of visibility distance for ordinary objects. 
Specification of the functional range of recognition vision is based on the concept of Civil
Twilight.  Early astronomers defined  Civil Twilight as the time period following sunset or
before sunrise when normal outdoor activities can be conducted without supplementary
illumination.  Psychophysical research later showed that visual functions such as acuity and
contrast sensitivity deteriorate rapidly over this range of illumination, thus providing scientific
validation of the astronomers' observations.  In the present approach, the headlight beam is
treated as a spatial analogue of changes in illumination during Civil Twilight.  Thus, the
practical limit of useful recognition vision is defined as the Twilight Distance, which is the
point that headlight illumination is equal to the darker limit of Civil Twilight.  Twilight
Distance distributions for low and high beams of different headlight systems are presented, and
implications for driver performance are discussed.<p>

The relationship between night myopia under simulated night driving conditions and the dark
focus of accommodation was examined.  Over a range of luminance and contrast conditions
typical of the night driving situation, college-aged subjects accommodated to about one-half
the difference between a distant simulated road sign and their individual dark focus. 
Subsequent laboratory and field experiments demonstrated that: (1) a negative correction equal
to one-half the value of the dark focus significantly improved night visual performance as
compared with their normal or full dark-focus correction, and (2) greater improvements in
performance were obtained for subjects who exhibited a relatively near dark focus.<p>

<p>

Two quasi-experiments investigated the contribution of reduced visibility to fatal accidents
recorded by the U.S. Fatal Accident Reporting System from 1980 through 1990.  Quasi-Experiment 1 evaluated 104,235 accidents that occurred during morning and evening time
periods, called Twilight Zones, during which natural illumination varied systematically in
conjunction with the annual solar cycle.  Fatal accidents were found to be overrepresented
during darker portions of the Twilight Zones.  This finding was no related to time of day, day
of week, or drivers' consumption of alcohol.  The contribution or reduced visibility was also
indicated by higher overrepresentation of fatal accidents in low illumination under adverse
atmospheric conditions and with pedestrians and pedalcyclists as opposes to all other accidents. 
Reduced visibility was more important than drivers' drinking as a contributor to fatal
pedestrian and pedalcycle accidents, while the reverse pattern was found for all other fatal
traffic accidents.  <p>

<p>

Quasi-Experiment 2 assessed the role of seasonal variables other than natural illumination by
comparing the monthly distributions of 337,726 accidents recorded during three time period: 
the Twilight  Zones plus equal-duration control periods of Daylight and Darkness.  The
distribution of fatal non-pedestrian accidents exhibited no substantial variation across months in 
any of the test periods.  The incidence of fatal pedestrian/pedalcycle accidents covaried with
natural illumination during the Twilight Zones, while showing no variation during Daylight
and Nighttime Control periods, confirming that visibility is a key factor in pedestrian and
pedalcycle accidents.  <p>

<p>

The present findings provide new evidence for both (1) the importance of visibility as a major
contributing factor in fatal pedestrian and pedalcycle accidents, and (2) the relative success of
previous efforts to deal with the difficulties of nighttime driving in other classes of fatal
accidents.  <p>

This study explored the possibility that drivers' ability to steer a vehicle under challenging
conditions may decline with advancing age.  Older drivers are frequently reluctant or unwilling
to drive at night, apparently because they lack confidence in their visual  capabilities. 
Although prudent, their insecurity at night stands in contrast to the overconfidence exhibited
by younger drivers.<p>

<p>

One theory proposes that the unrealistic confidence of younger night drivers is related to
selective degradation of vision in low light.  Reduced luminance is not uniformly deleterious to
all visual functions.  Over the range of luminances encountered in night driving,  recognition
or focal visual functions, like acuity and contrast sensitivity, deteriorate rapidly with reduced
luminance.  In contrast, guidance or ambient visual functions, such as visually induced feelings
of self-motion (vection), remain highly efficient until luminance falls to near the absolute
scotopic threshold.  Theoretically, the latter class of visual function, which service in very low
luminance, are of primary importance for guidance of locomotion.  <p>

<p>

Although appealing conceptually, the selective degradation hypothesis has not been tested in
the context of the driving task.  As a preliminary step toward such investigations, we have
conducted experiments using a simple night driving simulator.  Performance was investigated
under challenging visual conditions that were designed to degrade selectively either recognition
or guidance vision.  Based on the selective degradation hypothesis, it was predicted that
steering performance would be relatively unaffected by reductions of luminance and image
clarity (blur).  Experiment I tested this hypothesis in a small sample of middle-aged subjects,
while Experiment II extended the investigation by evaluating the effects of reduced luminance
on steering performance of younger and elder subjects. <p>

<p>

Experiment I showed that the visual guidance in the simulator task was disrupted by a
restriction of peripheral vision, which had little or no effect on visual acuity.  Conversely,
myopic refractive errors severely degraded visual acuity, but had [no] effect on steering
accuracy.  Experiment II showed that the resistance of steering performance to degradation in
low light declines with age, and examination of the combined data from both experiments
suggests that the age-related losses of visual guidance at night may develop progressively over
the adult life span.  In sum, the research findings provide new support, as well as interesting
limitations of the selective degradation hypothesis.<p>

Abstract:	Previous studies of spatial contrast sensitivity in adulthood have produced
conflicting results.  To clarify the situation, we measured contrast sensitivity function on a
large sample of adults (n=91), ranging in age from 19 to 87.  All observers were free from
significant ocular pathology and were individually refracted for the test distance.  Sensitivity
for stationary gratings of low spatial frequency remained the same throughout adulthood.  At
higher spatial frequencies, sensitivity decreased with age beginning around 40 to 50 years. 
When a low spatial frequency grating was drifted, young adults' sensitivity improved by a
factor of 4-5 over sensitivity to a static grating; this motion enhancement was markedly
diminished in adults over 60 years, implying an impairment of temporal processing in the
elderly.  Reduced retinal illuminance characteristic of the aged eye could account for a large
part of older adults deficit in spatial vision, but appeared to play little role in their deficit in
temporal vision.<p>

Luminance thresholds for contours moving at 2/sec, 5/sec, or 9/sec of visual angle were
measured after adaptation periods in which contours moving at each of several different
angular velocities were viewed.  The range of velocities of adapting motion was /sec to
45/sec.  Thresholds for conditions when adapting and test motions were in the same direction
were elevated relative to conditions when adapting and test motions were in opposite
directions.  Largest threshold elevations were obtained when adapting and test contour
velocities were similar.  The results indicate that the human visual system contains different
velocity-sensitive mechanisms, each of which is most responsive to a specific range of contour
velocities.<p>

A study of the North Carolina Driver Medical Evaluation Program was undertaken to assess
the effects of the program upon objective measures of the driving task.  The study group was
formed of 4,117 subjects who were medically evaluated and submitted to a system of restraints
imposed upon their operation of motor vehicles during the two-year period from September,
1968 through August 31, 1970.  Accidents and selected violations compiled from the official
driving record were collected over a year's time in both retrospective and prospective periods
relative to the subject's induction into the evaluation process.  Driving performance was
examined for each class of restriction and from every stage of the medical evaluation process. 
Driving performance was examined for each class of restriction and from every stage of the
medical evaluation process.  Comparisons were made within the experimental groups and
against a random sample from the general driving population.<p>

<p>

The data suggest a consistent measure of improvement in driving performance for medically
evaluated subjects.<p>

A DRIVER'S COMPETENCE to safely operate a motor vehicle is determined through one of
several systems currently in operation in official state agencies throughout the United States. 
The North Carolina system is usually applied in three consecutive stages: <p>

	(1)  A <u>written exam</u> testing the applicant's knowledge of motor vehicle laws,
regulations, motor vehicle operation and adjustment to various road situations. <p>

	(2)  A <u>visual exam</u> for static acuity and color perception, usually incorporating
recognition of road signs and other traffic regulation devices. <p>

	(3)  A <u>road test</u> in the applicant's vehicle over a prescribed course subjectively
graded from a check list by the license examiner.<p>

This is a "Practice and Opinion" article advocating a functional approach, rather than one
based on medical diagnosis, to determine whether drivers with neurological impairments
should be allowed to drive.  It also suggests that simulator testing is useful for patient testing. 
Quotes Drachman (1988), recommending that "limitations of driving privileges should be
based on the demonstration of impaired driving competence rather than on a stigmatizing
label."<p>

To identify the impairment effects of alcohol on driving performance and to determine whether
providing enhanced visual information concerning roadway alignment would improve the
performance of subjects when sober and/or alcohol-dosed, simulations of continuous roadway
treatments (i.e., standard and wide edgelines) were evaluated experimentally. Twelve subjects
drove a simulator at three levels of blood alcohol concentration (BAC: 0.00%, 0.07%,
0.12%).  The effects of alcohol included increases in the number of times the speed limit was
exceeded, the number of obstacles that were struck, and the magnitude of tracking errors that
were made in the approach and negotiation of curves.  Edgeline presence was associated with
faster curve entry speeds and reduced amount of road used in curve negotiation, both
interpreted as positive effects.  Additional benefits associated with wide edgelines were
minimal.<p>

Results which authors interpret as positive could be seen as negative.  Increased speed entering
curves could be one aspect of proposed (see Leibowitz, et al) outcome in nighttime and low-visibility conditions, when ambient cues are not degraded, leading driver to drive too fast for
degraded focal visual abilities. <p>

A battery of closed-course driving and laboratory tests were developed for evaluating the skills
required in routine suburban driving.  Twenty-three younger (aged 30-51) and twenty-one
older (aged 74-83) adults participated.  Driving tests included responding to traffic signals,
selection of routes, avoidance of moving hazards, and judgment at narrow gaps.  Lab tests
included measures of perceptual style, selective attention, reaction time, visual acuity,
perceptual speed and risk-taking propensity.  Older drivers were generally slower and less
consistent in their driving.  No differences were found between the groups on measures of
caution.  In the lab, older drivers scored lower on tasks requiring rapid switching of attention. 
Differences on lab measures were larger, reflecting the greater difficulty of these tasks and
thee greater precision available  in the laboratory.  The pattern of greater variability of
performance for the older drivers underscores the importance of not judging driving ability on
the basis of chronological age.<p>

Fifty subjects, ranging in age from 30 to  83, participated in a closed-course driving test and in
laboratory tests of information processing.  Driving tests included responding to traffic signals, 
selection of routes, avoidance of moving hazards, and judgment at stationary gaps.  Lab tests
included measures of perceptual style, selective attention, reaction time, visual acuity,
perceptual speed and risk-taking propensity.  Analyses were conducted to determine how well
lab measures predicted driving performance.  Results revealed different patterns of correlations
for different age groups.  For younger drivers (30-41), lab measures generally showed no
association with measures of driving performance.  For older drivers (74-83), measures of
information-processing were associated with overall rated driving performance, while
measures of reaction time showed strong correlations with objective driving measures.  The
results suggested that different mechanisms are utilized by drivers of different ages, and that
the slowing of reaction time associated with aging has  effects on driving skills related to
vehicle control.<p>

The threshold of stereopsis (mean deviation in sec of arc) of three observers was measured at
2 intervals from 8 right to 8 left in the horizontal meridian of the binocular field.  A simple
two-point target, along with a binocular fixation point, was presented by use of a mirror
haploscope.  Disparity was introduced by varying the separation of the two peripheral points in
one eye.  Judgments of the relative depth of the two binocular peripheral points were based on
these disparity cues.  The data show a decrease of stereoscopic acuity as a function of
horizontal offset.  There is a slight discontinuity in the curve, near 4 to 6, which may
correspond to a rod-cone density change.<p>

Visual pathway disorders can cause visual loss that is not detected by the Snellen test: visual
sensitivity to coarse detail may be depressed, even when visual sensitivity to fine detail is
unaffected.  Sinewave grating test targets can detect such hidden visual loss.  However,
electronic apparatus for generating sinewave gratings is expensive, while the inexpensive
Arden plates provide no check on the patient's accuracy.  We have tested 10 patients and 10
control subjects with a set of five letter charts (including the standard Snellen chart).  These
letter charts were of different contrasts, namely 10%, 22%, 31%, 64% and 93%, but
otherwise were substantially alike.  Subjects were also tested with sinewave gratings.  We
found good agreement between sinewave grating and letter chart findings.  In particular, the
charts picked up visual loss that was not detected by the standard Snellen chart: they detected
visual pathway dysfunction in all seven patients whose sinewave data were abnormal.  Our
findings suggest that even one low-contrast letter chart could provide a valuable supplement to
the standard Snellen chart.  Compared with other available devices, these charts have the
advantages of cheapness, simplicity and of providing the ophthalmologist with an immediate
check on patients' accuracy.<p>

Although driving is an important ability for maintaining independence in the later years,
clinical factors that determine status are unknown.  Aged male veterans (mean age, 70 years)
were recruited from an outpatient clinic (N = 143), including 77 frequent drivers, 41
infrequent drivers, and 25 who drive rarely or not at all.  There were 116 (84%) who
completed a comprehensive performance-based assessment.  There were no significant
differences between the three groups in age, formal cognitive testing, or prevalence of stroke
history.  However, there were significant differences in grip strength, reaction time, static
visual acuity, dynamic visual acuity, and peripheral vision.  Using stepwise ordinal logistic
regression, dynamic visual acuity, nondominant handgrip strength, and total horizontal
peripheral visual field were significantly associated with driving frequency (<i>p</i>&lt;.05), and
together explained approximately 45% of the variance.  Subtle motor and visual deficits that
can be detected in a performance-based assessment may play an important role in determining
driving frequency in the elderly.<p>

Looked only at association of vision and other measures with self-reported driving frequency. 
Did not test driving performance directly, nor did they look at driving history, accident
records (discussion addresses these issues).   These results may be seen as suggestive of tests
that might be investigated as predictors of driving performance.  <p>

This study compared two-year accident and conviction rates of visually impaired heavy-vehicle
operators  (with Class 1 or 2 licensure) to those of a sample of visually nonimpaired  heavy-vehicle operators.  Nonimpaired drivers met  current federal acuity standards (corrected acuity
of 20/40 or better in both eyes) while impaired drivers had substandard static acuity and were
assessed within either moderately (corrected acuity between 20/40 and 20/200 in the worse
eye, 20/40 or better in the other) or severely (corrected acuity worse than 20/200 Snellen in
the worse eye) impaired subgroups.  California and total mileage estimates for Class 1 and
Class 2 drivers obtained in a mailed questionnaire did not differ significantly between
impairment groups.  However, other potential bias issues remained  and are discussed. 
Visually impaired drivers had significantly more total accidents (37.15%) and convictions
(48.38%) than did the nonimpaired drivers.  The severely impaired drivers had directionally
worse records than did the moderately impaired drivers on three of the four traffic safety
measures.  These findings lead to qualified support for the current federal standard,
particularly regarding the severely impaired, with less support of its application regarding the
moderately impaired heavy-vehicle operator.<p>

Test-retest reliability was measured for three contrast sensitivity testing procedures:  a CRT-based test using a forced-choice staircase procedure, the Vistech VCTS sinewave grating chart,
and the Pelli-Robson letter chart.  Sixty-six normal subjects and 64 patients, 16 to 83 years of
age, took each test twice.<p>

<p>

Test-retest reliability was assessed by computing the intraclass correlation coefficient for each
test at each spatial frequency.  This correlation coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, with a value of
1 indicating perfect test-retest agreement.<p>

<p>

Test-retest reliability was generally lower with the Vistech grating chart than with the CRT-based test.  The difference was especially marked at low spatial frequencies.   The Pelli-Robson letter chart had very high test-retest reliabilities.<p>

<p>

The Vistech chart was twice as likely as the CRT test to produce anomalous CSFs.  Twenty-four observers - 15 normal, 9 patient - had a significant "notch" or low frequency specific loss
on one Vistech test that did not appear on the other Vistech test.  Twelve observers-5 normal,
7 patient-had anomalous CSFs with the CRT test.  A single measure of visual acuity was as
good a predictor of CRT contrast sensitivity at each spatial frequency as was Vistech contrast
sensitivity.<p>

A movement with constant velocity looks fast in the beginning and later slows down, whereas
a certain type of accelerated motion (natural motion) looks constant throughout.  It was
predicted that early occlusion of a constant motion would lead to overestimation of velocity
whereas late occlusion would not.  With natural motion, there would be no such difference. 
Constant and natural motions together with constant deceleration and constant acceleration
motions were tested in a modified prediction-of-collision experiment.  The results agree well
with the predictions.  It was concluded that the phenomena previously found are operative also
in a more complex perceptual task where the observer's attention is not focused on velocity
directly.  The visual system seems to achieve perception of partly occluded motion by applying
a natural motion function rather than constant velocity.  Acquaintance with the phenomena
does not seem to alter the way they are perceived.<p>

Abstract: Author's "summary of recommendations and future research requirements"<p>

<p>

The objective of visual screening for older drivers should be optimization rather that
prohibition or restriction.  Special tests that are sensitive to the frequent ocular pathologies of
old age are emerging.  When detected, most of these age-related visual disorders can be
corrected by prompt medical intervention.  Hence, successful optimization screening of the
elderly would not result in significant increases in the loss of driving privileges; instead, it
would yield improved visual functioning with an accompanying increase in driving safety,
mobility, and efficiency.<p>

<p>

Studies should be conducted to quantify the effectiveness of contrast sensitivity techniques and
low-contrast acuity testing for improving the mobility and productivity of the older driver
population.  Laboratory and clinical evidence clearly demonstrates that contrast sensitivity
provides screening sensitivity for age-related visual pathologies that most often elude detection
by traditional acuity measures.  The modes of contrast sensitivity measurement that yield the
most information on age-related ocular pathologies (e.g., cataract, glaucoma, and retinal
disorders) are expensive to administer because of the apparatus and testing time required.  In
addition, standardized procedures for collecting and scoring CSF data remain to be developed. 
Recent findings have indicated that low-contrast acuity tests may yield a large subset of the
information made available by CSF procedures.  Unlike the contrast sensitivity techniques,
low-contrast acuity tests are simple to administer and interpret.  The costs and benefits of these
two emerging techniques need to be carefully examined before either is implemented in a
mass-screening application such as driver vision testing.  The potential for employing a glare
stressor for increasing the diagnostic selectivity of these methods needs to be explored.  Both
the contrast sensitivity paradigm and the low-contrast acuity technique hold promise for
improving the level of visual functioning of older drivers.<p>

<p>

Advanced technology should be applied to automate driver-screening tasks.  The emergence of
low-cost computers and high-resolution displays has made it possible to develop a general-purpose vision test station for mass screening applications.  Such a system could be used to
implement fully automated administration of existing vision and driving knowledge and
information tests.  Computerized, video-based vision testers possess the characteristics
required to implement emerging visual assessment techniques, such as contrast sensitivity and
low contrast acuity testing, and have the design flexibility to support anticipated future
developments in vision testing, such as those incorporating motion and higher-order
information-processing skills.<p>

<p>

Mandatory periodic retesting of older drivers should be initiated by all driver-licensing
agencies.  All of the data collected to date clearly indicate that visual function is prone to
dramatic changes during the latter part of the human life span.  These data need to be carefully
analyzed to show changes in the incidence rates of various visual disorders as a function of
age.  These quantitative data should then serve as the basis for scientifically determining the
age at and frequency with which visual retesting is to be conducted.  Such a process would
ensure that subsequently determined retest selection criteria would be based on facts rather
than arbitrary conventions.  The development of advanced automated vision-testing systems
would make it possible to administer an ambitious retesting program in a cost-effective
manner. <p>

<p>

The following three steps need to be taken:<p>

<p>

Establish a photopic acuity illumination standard that is free of potential age bias.<p>

Transfer automated full-field perimetry technology to one amenable to mass
screening.<p>

Explore the costs and benefits of employing CBI for continuing driver education.<p>

Future attempts to establish causal relationships between measures of visual function and
driving performance should employ simulation studies rather than rely entirely on correlational
designs.<p>

<p>

The feasibility and desirability of cognitive competence screening of driver's license and
renewal applicants also need to be studied.<p>

Many subhuman species and human infants, children, and adults can use two-dimensional
information of relative rate of angular-size change to anticipate collisions between the self and
approaching objects or surfaces.  But extant studies have not determined what information is
used when subjects view simulated approach events providing two-dimensional information
and three-dimensional information (distance and distance change), as well as lower-order
visual information contained in real approach events.  Three experiments suggest that, given
these several possibilities, adults' judgments of collision time are best predicted by two-dimensional spatiotemporal values which are invariant over object size, distance traversed,
approach velocities, and several lower-order variables such as absolute angular size. 
However, collision time is substantially underestimated, with absolute amount of
underestimation increasing as a function of actual time-to-collision.  Large constant errors and
loss of judgment linearity beyond about 10 s to contact time suggest that current models of
human performance based on use of time-to-collision information require modified
assumptions of operator efficiency.<p>

Visually-guided orientation (spatial localization) and visual discrimination were dissociated by
means of brain lesions in the golden hamster.  After ablation of visual cortex, hamsters failed
to discriminate visual patterns, but showed nearly normal ability to localize an object in space
by means of vision.  Ablation of the superior colliculus produced opposite effects: these
animals were completely unable to orient to the position of a visual stimulus, but nevertheless
showed excellent pattern discrimination. <p>

Foveal and peripheral target detection were compared in young adults (<i>M</i> age = 22 years) and
older adults (<i>M</i> age = 66 years) who were optically corrected for the viewing distance.  In a
two-alternative, forced-choice task, target letters were presented at 0 to 10.5 from fixation. 
Targets were presented alone, flanked on each side by one noise element (i.e., non-target
letter), or embedded in a horizontal row of 19 noise elements.  An Age x Noise Level x
Location interaction was obtained, wherein age differences were largest for peripheral targets
presented in noise.  Slope analyses of latency data showed that the performance of young
adults in the high-noise condition was most similar to that of older adults in the low-noise
condition.  At the functional level, results indicated that aging is associated with a restricted
useful field of view.  In addition, the data suggest that age differences in search can be
described by a model in which older adults take smaller perceptual samples from the visual
scene and scan these samples more slowly than do the young adults.<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

If this finding is supported when tested in more naturalistic, driving-related scenarios, it would
be a significant issue for CDL.  Might support additional or more frequent testing of older
drivers.  Mean age of "older adults" group was only 66, suggesting that effect can be seen in
people young enough to still be employed.  Consider this in combination with other literature
suggesting that useful field can be expanded by training.<p>

This report collects in one document the important research literature on temporal factors in
vision.  Over 350 scientific articles are cited herein and this represents approximately 10
percent of the data base which was consulted.  The literature searched was comprised of the
following: 1) Several thousand articles (under the general rubric <u>temporal factors</u> and
<u>information processing</u>) from existing reprint files of the authors and others; 2) <u>Ergonomics
Abstracts, Psychological Bulletins, Psychological Reviews</u> and <u>Human Factors</u> for the last 12
years; 3) a listing from two automated look-up systems (Psychological Abstracts 1967-present
and National Technical Information System 1964-present).  An integrative review of the
literature is provided and three chapters are included which deal with application of these
findings to display design.  The subject matter is perception of temporal events--specifically
motion perception (real and apparent) and flicker/flash sensitivity.  A small chapter covers
some temporally based phenomena which distort or degrade perception.  Features of these
phenomena may be observed in visual displays.  Only studies which report findings which are
robust enough to be expected to be important outside the laboratory are included.  Where
sufficient data were available, equations are provided to the engineer for the calculation of
design criteria (e.g., peripheral motion threshold, contrast thresholds, contrast thresholds and
age, etc.).  Where gaps exist in our scientific knowledge, recommendations are provided for
applied research.  General guidelines are offered for incorporating design criteria into Military
Standard 1472 for perceptions due to temporal events.<p>

Abstract:	A linear structural model of mechanism underlying spatial vision was generated
from the variance-covariance matrix of contrast sensitivity data.  The data had been collected
on a large group of observers ranging in age from 19 to 87 yr, using gratings of 0.5-16 c/deg
spatial frequency.  Structural models incorporating various numbers of spatial frequency-tuned
mechanisms were compared, with a three-mechanism model giving the best account of the
data.  The same analysis was applied to contrast sensitivity data simulated from Wilson and
Bergen's (1979) model.  When the stimulated data covered 0.5-16 c/deg, only three
mechanisms were needed to give a satisfactory account of the data; when the simulated data
covered 0.25-16 c/deg, four mechanisms were required.  Peak sensitivities and bandwidths of
the mechanisms extracted from the simulated data resembled those extracted from the real,
population data.  This reinforces the idea that at an early stage of human vision a small number
of spatially-tuned mechanisms are operative.  In addition, the outcome of analyses with both
real and simulated data illustrates the potential value of linear structural models for vision
research.<p>

An evaluation of a fully automated battery of driving related vision tests was conducted on 890
licensed drivers ranging in age from 17 to 89.  The tests measured static central visual acuity
under conditions of optimal illumination, low levels of illumination, and glare; dynamic visual
acuity, visual field, movement detection threshold in the central and peripheral fields, and
visual search-and-scan ability.  In a previous paper (1) the test-retest reliability of the vision
tests was discussed.  The present paper summarizes the main findings of this study with
particular emphasis on the relationship between driver accident involvement and drivers
performance on the vision tests.  Regression analysis regressing performance on the vision test
against accident involvement yielded multiple correlations ranging from .09 to .30 - depending
on the particular driver age group and the accident condition (day vs. night).  The results
indicated that:  1. dynamic visual acuity and static acuity under low levels of illumination were
the two tests that were most consistently related to accidents in general, as well as to driver-caused and vision-related accidents in particular.  2.  poor static acuity under low levels of
illumination was specifically associated with overinvolvement in night-time accidents.  3.  the
third most relevant vision test was sensitivity to central angular movement.  4.  When broken
down by age groups, it was found that no single vision test was significantly associated with
accident involvement for all age groups but each one of the vision tests was significantly
associated with accident involvement for one or more of the age groups.  Further analyses
indicated that additional changes in equipment and procedures are necessary before the battery
can be used in the driver licensing environment.<p>

Abstract:<p>

<p>

In a previous paper, Shinar, Mayer and Treat [1975] evaluated the reliability and validity of a
battery of 17 driving-related vision tests.  The present paper reports progress made in the
development of these tests towards the  establishment of an integrated battery of license branch
oriented driver vision screening tests.  In an effort to expedite the testing procedure, the eleven
most promising tests of the original 17 were incorporated in a fully automated battery. The
tests yield measures of static central visual acuity under conditions of optimal illumination, low
levels of illumination, and glare; dynamic visual acuity, visual field, movement thresholds in
the central and peripheral fields, and visual search-and-scan ability.  Evaluation of the new
battery is proceeding in four directions:  the reliability of the tests; their validity as predictors
of accident involvement; the practicality of the device as a license branch test; and the
development of diagnostic and remediation procedures for people who might fail the tests. The
results reported below indicate that most of the tests are reliable, insofar as yielding similar
results on the test and retest.  This is especially true for subjects who perform well, and less so
for subjects who perform poorly, i.e., those who would be candidates for failing the test.  In
its present form, the device is not sufficiently portable to be transferred from one branch to
another as the need demands.  It does, however, constitute a large improvement over the
previous battery in terms of the test administration time (approximately 15 minutes), the fact
that administration and scoring is totally automated, and the high degree of acceptance of this
type of test for licensing procedures (over 90% of the subjects enjoyed taking the test and
indicated approval of its inclusion in the license testing and procedures).  Validation data is
incomplete at this time since 72% of the drivers tested to date have not had a single accident in
the last five years.  A diagnostic procedure has been developed which includes a battery of
standard clinical tests and a diagnostically-oriented driver vision test battery to be installed in a
vision specialist's office.  Future plans include a nationwide validation effort oriented towards
the establishment of pass/fail criteria that would be consistent with a driver's likelihood of
accident involvement.<p>

Efforts to assess visual deterioration with increasing age, coupled with new mechanisms
proposed to limit the exposure of visually impaired drivers to driving risks, have emerged in
response to the increase in older drivers.  Visual functions discussed in this context include
static acuity (photopic, mesopic, and in the presence of glare), dynamic visual acuity, visual
field, contrast sensitivity, and motion perception.  Exposure control mechanisms discussed
include alternative periodic vision testing strategies, visual training, and environmental and
vehicular modifications to accommodate the older driver.  Finally, relevant research needs are
addressed.<p>

Volume II consists of a review of the research on the personality characteristic of field
dependence as it relates to driver behavior and accident involvement. <p>

<p>

The review is divided into two parts.  The first part is concerned with the nature of field
dependence as a theoretical concept, its relationship to other measures of individual
differences, and its methods of measurement.  The second part deals with the relationship
between field dependence and highway safety in terms of driving behavior and accident
involvement.<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

Looks at research (up to 1978) suggesting that field-dependent drivers may have reduced
peripheral vision capabilities, other driving related deficits vs. field-independent drivers.  <p>

<p>

The effects of age and ametropia (nearsightedness or farsightedness) on the dark focus of
visual accommodation have not been extensively investigated.  Participant pools of  students
are generally screened and their vision "standardized" by testing them while they wear their
corrective lenses.  In this study, nearsighted and farsighted subjects were measured for their
near points, far points, and dark focuses.  It was found that the more nearsighted the eye the
larger the dark focus shift.  Age was also found to have a relationship to the dark focus.  Older
individuals tended to have a smaller dark focus shift, and the dark focus was found to recede
with age at roughly the same rate as the far point.<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

Looked at age, near point, far point, dark focus.  Used concept of "relative dark focus,"
measuring difference between far point and dark focus as index of relative dark focus effects
across subjects.  This is useful in addressing the issues of whether some populations (e.g.,
older subjects, myopes) are more severely affected than others by dark focus shifts.<p>

In normal illumination, retrograde motion of the background (the Filehne illusion) can be seen
during ocular pursuit, in contrast to stability seen during a saccade.  In the present experiment,
two stimuli were presented sequentially: (I) at disparate physical locations such that the pursuit
movement of the eye caused them to excite the same retinal location, (II) at the same physical
location, with pursuit movement causing disparate retinal excitations, and (III) with stationary
fixation but with disparate physical locations such that the retinal excitation was identical to
that of Condition II.  Optimal movement was never reported for Condition I but was reported
with essentially equal frequency in Conditions II and III.  These results indicate a failure of
compensation for pursuit movement, as does the Filehne illusion.  The nature of the pursuit
extraretinal signal was discussed, and it was argued that a distinctly different extraretinal signal
is necessary for perceived stability during the saccade.<p>

1.  The effects of temporal modulation on the properties of spatial frequency channels have
been investigated using adaptation.<p>

<p>

2.  Adapting to drifting sinusoidal gratings caused threshold elevation that was both spatial
frequency and direction specific.  Little systematic difference was found between the band
widths of the elevation curves for drifting and stationary gratings.<p>

<p>

3.  It was confirmed that adaptation fails to reveal channels at low spatial frequencies when
stationary gratings are used.  However, channels were revealed at frequencies at least as low as
0  66 c/deg when the test gratings were made to move.  These channels are adapted only a
little by stationary gratings, confirming their dependence on movement.<p>

<p>

4.  The existence of movement-sensitive channels at low spatial frequencies explains the well
known observation that temporal modulation greatly increases the sensitivity of the visual
system to low spatial frequencies.<p>

<p>

5.  Temporal modulation was effective at revealing these channels only when the flicker or
movement of the test patterns was apparent to the observer; only at low spatial frequencies did
patterns, modulated at low rates, actually appear to be temporarily modulated at threshold.  At
higher spatial frequencies, they were indistinguishable from stationary patterns until the
contrast was some way above the detection threshold.<p>

<p>

6.  It is suggested, therefore, that the movement-sensitive channels are responsible for
signaling the occurrence of movement; the channels at higher spatial frequencies give no
information about temporal changes.  These two systems of channels are compared to the Y-
and X-cells respectively of the cat.<p>

Experiments with split-brain monkeys led me to consider that vision of space and vision of
object identity may be subserved by anatomically distinct brain mechanisms.  In this paper I
examine the visual mechanisms of the brain to test the idea that vision involves two parallel
processes; one <i>ambient</i>, determining space at large around the body, the other <i>focal </i>which
examines detail in small areas of space.  In vertebrates there is a projection from eye to
midbrain of a detailed topography of body-centered behavioral space.  This visual map is
integrated with the bisymmetric motor system to obtain correspondence between visual loci
and the goal for movements.  The midbrain visual system governs basic vertebrate locomotion
behavior.<p>

<p>

The phylogenetically more recent forebrain visual system looks almost exclusively at central
behavioral space, and cortical motor control is likewise concerned with the formulation of
highly specific acts in the same central territory.<p>

<p>

Anatomy and brain surgery reveal a midbrain visual mechanism in primate which plays a part
in ambient space perception over the whole field.  In contrast, focal vision served by the fovea
and parafovea and by the cortical visual areas picks out areas in the ambient field for close
attention.  Conjugate eye movements are the most direct sign of this attention.<p>

<p>

The interplay between the two channels of visual analysis is a feature of vision in all active
animals; but the complexity of focal vision in primates is revealed in their visual system at all
levels, and in the parts of the motor system which orient vision, or which govern acts directed
to specific visual objects. <p>

The development of computer-based cognitive test batteries for the assessment of human
performance in applied work settings stems from models of human information processing that
describe critical stages of processing in the order: sensor - central processor - effector.  This
study showed that unique limitations on sensory systems can influence the quality and quantity
of information that may be initially registered and therefore may potentially affect all the
processes that follow.  The importance of accounting for simpler sensory processes first and
before more centrally dependent cognitive and information processing factors should not be
overlooked when attempting to predict human performance in the workplace.<p>

Stereoscopic acuity in the human fovea remains unimpaired with retinal image motions of up
to 2 deg/s.  These findings apply to lateral motion of the test target alone, and to simultaneous
lateral motion of both test and comparison targets.  For good stereoscopic acuity, depth motion
can be tolerated only so long as the configuration does not move outside the disparity zone for
optimal stereoscopic acuity, within 2-3 arc min of either side of the fixation plane.  The
presence during a short exposure of some stimulus components lying outside this zone leads to
an overall reduction of stereoscopic acuity, either by dilution through summation, or by active
inhibition of the best achievable depth resolution.<p>

The results of three tachistoscopic experiments are reported, which suggest that the functional
or useful field of view is very sensitive to foveal demands (load).  As the foveal primary task
becomes more difficult, peripheral information extraction is perturbed, and it is perturbed
increasingly as the retinal eccentricity of the peripheral information increases.  This is the case
even when compensatory adjustments are made for acuity loss.  The results are discussed in
terms of tunnel vision and general interference models.<p>

The aim of the study was to determine the effect on driving of restricting vision.  This was
undertaken by comparing the driving performance of young, normal subjects under conditions
of simulated visual impairment with a baseline condition.  Visual impairment was simulated
using goggles designed to replicate the effects of cataracts, binocular visual field restriction,
and monocular vision.  All subjects had visual acuity greater than 6/12 [metric] when wearing
the goggles and thus satisfied the visual requirements for a driver's license [Australian]. 
Driving performance was assessed on a closed-road circuit for a series of driving tasks
including peripheral awareness, maneuvering, reversing, reaction time, speed estimation, road
position, and time to complete the course.  Simulated cataract resulted in the greatest detriment
to driving performance, followed by binocular visual field restriction.  The monocular
condition did not significantly affect driving performance for any of the driving tasks assessed.<p>

The importance of the visual field on driving performance was investigated.  This was
undertaken by simulating binocular visual field defects for a group of young normal subjects
and assessing the impact of these defects on performance on a driving course.  Constriction of
the binocular visual field to 40 or less, significantly increased time taken to complete the
course, reduced the ability to detect and correctly identify road signs, avoid obstacles and to
manoeuvre through limited space.  Accuracy of road positioning and reversing were also
impaired.  Constriction of the binocular visual field did not significantly affect speed
estimation, stopping distance, or the time taken for the reversing and manoeuvring tasks.  The
monocular condition did not significantly affect performance for any of the driving tasks
assessed.<p>

<p>

Notes:<p>

<p>

Simulated field restrictions with pinhole goggles, but used actual driving on closed course to
assess impairment of driving functions.  Provides limited evidence for validity of some kind of
visual field testing for driver licensing.  Authors seem most impressed by how little the
subjects' performance was impaired.  Does not speak to how testing should be done, or to
visual field losses less severe than those tested here.  Monocular condition showed little effect
on driving scores, but authors caution that subjects were young and otherwise had no
impairments, and were tested in daylight conditions only.<p>

Abstract:<p>

<p>

This is a final report of a study whose purpose was to  provide an evaluative review of existing
knowledge in the fields of traffic safety, driver behavior, and psychology with respect to
driver inattention. <p>

<p>

Volume I represents the main part of the review and includes the following sections:  a
discussion of basic concepts, theories, measurement techniques, and research paradigms in
studies of attention and driver performance; a multi-dimensional definition of attentional
performance in the context of driving behavior; an analysis of inattention-related traffic
accidents; a survey of behavioral and physiological indicators of inattention; a survey of
individual differences in attentional performance; a detailed delineation of unresolved research
issues; and recommendations for future research aimed at developing driver-oriented
inattention countermeasures.<p>

We investigated the effects of vitamin A supplementation in an individual with abnormally low
vitamin A-containing transthyretin-bound retinol binding protein (RBP).  Measures of spectral
dark adaptation and spatial contrast sensitivity suggest a differential return of parafoveal and
foveal receptor systems during supplementation.  Parafoveal cone systems appear to return
more rapidly than foveal cones and rods.  Post-supplementation measurements of spectral dark
adaptation demonstrated a crossing of spectral dark adaptation functions at 6.5 minutes, close
to the appearance of the rod cone break attributed to achromatic measurements of dark
adaptation.  Contrast sensitivity for the finest spatial frequency showed a delay in its return to
near normal levels relative to recovery of mid to low spatial frequencies.  While measures of
serum retinol, total RBP, and free RBP increased during supplementation, transthyretin-bound
RBP failed to show any increase relative to its abnormally low presupplementation level. 
Bodily stores of vitamin A either require more time to return to normal levels than retinol
delivered to the retina or this individual possessed a specific genetic deficiency in the bodily
mechanism responsible for storing vitamin A.<p>
