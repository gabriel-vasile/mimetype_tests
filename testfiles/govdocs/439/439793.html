      <p align="left">The objective of this work is to understand how the parameters 
        <br>
        that lead to efficient photoinduced electron transfer in natural <br>
        photosynthetic systems contribute to the efficiency of solar energy<br>
        conversion in semiconductor-based model systems. The <br>
        reproduction of the early stages of natural photosynthesis is a <br>
        necessary step for designing and optimizing efficient artificial <br>
        photosynthetic systems. We study the role of sequential electron<br>
        transfer, and electrochemical parameters, to understand how they <br>
        affect charge separation distance and efficiency. In current work<br>
        we build upon our previous understanding of the enhanced <br>
        coupling between metal oxide surfaces and modifiers having<br>
        bidentate bihydroxyl ligands. Special binding mechanisms lead to <br>
        an enhanced rate of forward electron transfer and delayed back<br>
        electron transfer. In order to follow the correlation of the rate of <br>
        back electron transfer with the charge separation distance, we <br>
        couple the surface modifier with oligonucleotides of different <br>
        sequences. The sequence is designed to have hole trapping sites <br>
        at different distances from the particle surface. Moreover, we <br>
        seek to understand the forces that finely tune the electron transfer <br>
        in model systems, such as hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions,<br>
        local electrostatic fields, or formation of secondary structures <br>
        obtained by self organization.</p>

        Research</b></font> 
      <p align="left">Surface modification of nanocrystalline metal oxide particles 
        with <br>
        ortho-substituted hydroxylated aromatic ligands was found to <br>
        result in bidentate coordination of surface Ti atoms. We have also <br>
        found that due to this specific binding of surface modifiers, the <br>
        optical properties of small titania particles change and the onset of<br>
        the optical absorption shifts to the red, compared to unmodified<br>
        nanocrystallites. The red shift is proportional to the number of <font face="symbol">p</font> 
        <br>
        electrons in the ligand participating in the charge transfer complex<br>
        (for dihydroxy cyclobutene dione 0.8 eV, ascorbate 1.6 eV and <br>
        dopamine 1.85 eV). The binding was found to be exclusively <br>
        characteristic of small particle colloids in the nanocrystalline <br>
        domain where surface Ti sites are coordinatively unsaturated. <br>
        Using XANES and EXAFS, we have previously shown that the <br>
        unique binding is a consequence of adsorption-induced <br>
        reconstruction of the nanoparticle surface.</p>
      <p align="left">The appearance of absorption in the visible region by surface<br>
        modification provides an alternative method for light sensitization <br>
        of large band gap semiconductors. These newly developed systems<br>
        have an important feature in that charge pairs are instantaneously<br>
        separated into two phases following photoexcitation. Using <br>
        continuous wave (cw) EPR we were able to establish identities<br>
        of radical species formed by excitation (visible light, <font face="symbol">l</font> 
        &gt; 500 nm)<br>
        of the charge transfer complex of 40 Å TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles with 
        <br>
        dopamine or ascorbic acid. Two light-induced reversible signals<br>
        attributed to oxidized donor and reduced acceptor in the continuous<br>
        light cw EPR spectrum were obtained. The first signal (g<sub>1</sub>= 
        1.988,<br>
        g<sub>2</sub>=1.961 and g<sub>2'</sub>=1.958 <font face="symbol">D</font>H<sub>pp</sub> 
        = 2.5 Gauss) is characteristic of <br>
        a radical in which the unpaired electron occupies the d-orbitals of <br>
        Ti atoms having a strong component of angular momentum. <b>[1 <br>
        stands for perpendicular; 2 stands for parallel].</b> No EPR <br>
        signals associated with the surface components were observed <br>
        (surface Ti centers, g<sub>1</sub>=1.924, g<sub>2</sub>=1.885), indicating 
        that dopamine<br>
        (ascorbate) ligands raise the energy of the surface trapping sites. <br>
        The second EPR signal at g=2.004 was dependent on the ligands <br>
        used for surface modification. In the case of modification with <br>
        ascorbate ligands, <font face="symbol">D</font>H<sub>pp</sub> was 11 Gauss. 
        A similar but broader <br>
        signal with g=2.004, <font face="symbol">D</font>H<sub>pp</sub> = 16 Gauss 
        was obtained when <br>
        dopamine was used as the surface modifier. The linewidth <br>
        decreased to <font face="symbol">D</font>H<sub>pp</sub> = 10 Gauss upon 
        using deuterated dopamine <br>
        | (ring D<sub>3</sub> or 2,2 D<sub>2</sub>). As the signal was dependent 
        on the nature<br>
        of the surface modifier, and photogenerated electrons were found <br>
        to be involved in the reduction of Ti, this signal can be assigned to 
        <br>
        the reversible trap for photogenerated holes. The fact that the<br>
        trapping is reversible suggests that oxidation is not followed by<br>
        proton loss forming an allylic radical.</p>
      <p align="left">By using time-resolved EPR techniques, on the other hand, 
        one <br>
        can observe the formation of the initial radical intermediates as well 
        <br>
        as monitor their spin dynamics in order to gain insight into the <br>
        electron transfer dynamics. The initial spin populations in <br>
        photogenerated radicals that are precursors to fully charge separated 
        <br>
        states were investigated using time-resolved direct detection (TRDD) <br>
        EPR. The EPR spectrum that we have obtained 1 microsecond <br>
        after the laser excitation at helium temperatures is composed of<br>
        two emissive lines (g=2.004 <font face="symbol">D</font>H<sub>pp</sub> 
        = 11 Gauss and g=1.995 <font face="symbol"><br>
        D</font>H<sub>pp</sub>= 4 Gauss) and one weakly absorptive line (g=1.988). 
        <br>
        The overall shift of the spectrum to net emission suggests that <br>
        a triplet state may be involved in determining the electron spin <br>
        polarization. The EPR spectrum of dopamine-modified 42 Å TiO<sub>2</sub> 
        <br>
        shows similar properties, except that the linewidth of dopamine<br>
        is larger, as observed in the corresponding cw EPR measurements. <br>
        We are exploring these results using multifrequency (X, Q, and <br>
        D bands) EPR and simulations to characterize the signal. Our<br>
        current thinking is that the spectrum is associated with the exciton <br>
        triplet state in which holes, localized on the surface modifier, are <br>
        strongly interacting with electrons, delocalized in the conduction <br>
        band of TiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
      <p align="left">Further investigation of the trapping process at longer 
        times using <br>
        the TRDD technique was not successful probably due to the <br>
        relaxation of the polarization and low sensitivity of the TRDD EPR<br>
        technique. However, by using light having flash duration that exceeds<br>
        the relaxation time T<sub>1</sub>, one can observe larger concentrations 
        of <br>
        nonrelaxed populations and use field modulation to enhance the <br>
        sensitivity of the EPR. We have obtained spin polarized signals by <br>
        using light-modulated - field-modulated (LFM) EPR measurements<br>
        at low temperatures. In these EPR spectra each transition was split<br>
        into a doublet of absorptive and emissive lines. In the case of <br>
        dopamine-modified samples the signal from photogenerated holes <br>
        was significantly broadened. These spectra indicate that upon <br>
        trapping onto Ti(III) centers, the interaction of electrons localized 
        <br>
        on TiO<sub>2</sub> particles and holes localized on the organic modifier 
        <br>
        becomes relatively weak, and therefore stabilizes the charge <br>
        separated state in the same manner as in the P<sup>+</sup>Q<sup>-</sup> 
        system in the<br>
        photosynthetic reaction center. [For the movie on spin polarization <br>

        the <br>
        characteristic correlated radical pair electron spin polarization <br>
        (CRPP), a signature for natural photosynthetic systems. Existence <br>
        of the spin polarization is the first evidence of the weak interaction 
        <br>
        of the electrons localized inside nanocrystalline particles and holes<br>
        localized on the surface adsorbed species.</p>
      <p align="left">Theoretical models have been used in order to simulate the 
        spectra <br>
        and determine the parameters of radical pairs. Theoretical analysis<br>
        demonstrates that the experimental spectra are satisfactorily fit with<br>
        the model for spin-correlated radical pairs. It was shown that a weak<br>
        dipole-dipole interaction (D ~4 Gauss) can account for interaction.<br>
        Using computer simulations of the spectra, the distance between<br>
        trapped electrons localized within the TiO<sub>2</sub> particle and trapped<br>
        holes localized on the surface modifier was found to be R<sub>e-h</sub> 
        ~19 Å, <br>
        in agreement with the particle radius of 21.5 Å. These results indicate<br>
        that photogenerated electrons are localized mainly in the center of the<br>
        TiO<sub>2</sub> particles. This result is even more striking because the 
        observed<br>
        distance between electrons and holes is larger than the exciton radius<br>
        in TiO<sub>2</sub> (&lt; 15 Å). Also, simulations show that the correlation 
        of <br>
        orientation of the dipole-dipole interaction vector in the magnetic<br>
        axes of electrons and holes is preserved. </p>

            radical pairs.</li>
          <li>Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the experimental spectra 
            <br>
            are satisfactorily fit with the model of spin-correlated radical<br>
            pairs with selective population of the sublevels. Using computer<br>
            simulations of the spectra, a distance between trapped electrons<br>
            localized within TiO<sub>2</sub> particles and trapped holes localized 
            on <br>
            the surface modifier of ~19 Å was determined. Simulations also <br>
            show the correlation between orientation of the dipole-dipole<br>
            interaction vector in the magnetic axes of electrons and holes.</li>
