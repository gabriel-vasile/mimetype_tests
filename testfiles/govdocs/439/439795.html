<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Objectives:</b> We are establishing a reactivity scale for reactions
at oxide mineral surfaces by determining rate coefficients for key <i>elementary</i>
reactions in model dissolved complexes. The <sup>17</sup>O-NMR method is used to determine
the rates of water exchange between the inner-coordination-sphere of Al(III)-ligand-H<sub>2</sub>O
complexes and the bulk solvent as a measure of the fundamental reactivity of the
inner-sphere metal-oxygen bonds. The broad features of this reactivity scale are
established (Phillips et al., 1997a; Phillips et al., 1997b) and we are now examining the
Al<sub>13</sub>(O<sub>4</sub>)OH<sub>24</sub>(H<sub> 2</sub>O)<sub>12</sub><sup>7+</sup>(aq)
multimer, which has key features in common with truncated monomolecular steps on aluminum
(hydr)oxide mineral surfaces. <i>Ab-initio</i> molecular-orbital calculations are also
underway via collaboration with Prof. J. Tossell at the University of Maryland to
establish a relation between bond lengths, bond strengths, and values in these, and other,
complexes (Figure 1). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Results:</b> </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>General Model</u> </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have established that rate coefficients describing metal detachment
from a mineral surface scale like rates of water exchange between bulk solvent and the
inner-coordination sphere of certain metal-ligand complexes (e.g., Casey and Westrich,
1992; Ludwig et al., 1995). The essential idea is that <u>stable</u> ligands in the
inner-coordination sphere of Al(III) modify the reactivity of other bonds to oxygens that
are also in the inner-coordination sphere. These elementary reaction rate coefficients
can, by hypothesis, be quantitatively used to predict rate coefficients for the surface
reactions (see Ludwig et al., 1995; 1996; Casey and Ludwig, 1996) if there is structural
similarity between the surface and dissolved complexes. Because the increase in reactivity
is usually accompanied by an increase in bond lengths, we are coupling these rate
measurements to molecular-orbital calculations to extend the rate data (Figure 1). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Figure 1:</b> The exchange of fluoride ions for hydration waters in
dissolved Al(III) complexes labilizes the remaining waters of hydration. This
ligand-directed labilization is probably accompanied by a bond lengthening, indicating
that a Linear-Free-Energy correlation can be established relating reactivity to bond
lengths and bond strengths in stable complexes. Bond lengths are in Angstrom units. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>Rates in Aluminum-Fluoride, -Oxalate and -Malonato Complexes</u> </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At 298 K, the rate coefficient for water exchange [<i>k<sup>298</sup></i>]
in <i>Al(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub><sup>3+</sup>(aq) </i>is 2.7(±1.2) s<sup>-1</sup>
(Phillips et al., 1997). Upon replacement of a single water of hydration with fluoride to
form the <i>AlF(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub><sup>2+</sup>(aq) </i>complex, the rate
coefficient increases to <font SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">»</font>10<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.
Upon adding a second fluoride ion, the rate coefficient increases to <font SIZE="2"
FACE="Symbol">»</font>20000 s<sup>-1</sup>. A similar result is found for aluminum
oxalate complexes, although the effect is not so dramatic. Replacement of waters of
hydration in <i>Al(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub><sup>3+</sup>(aq)</i> to form the bidentate
monooxalato complex [i.e.,<i> Al(C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub> 4</sub><sup>+</sup>(aq)</i>]
causes <i>k<sup>298</sup></i> to increase to <font SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">»</font>10<sup>2</sup>
s<sup>-1</sup>. Our current work on methylmalonato-complexes indicates that important
complexities can arise. The <i>k<sup>298</sup></i> values were predicted (Figure 2) to
scale with the equilibrium constant and with the size of the ring formed by the chelate
and the Al(III) metal; in other words, oxalato- complexes would be more reactive than
malonato complexes of similar structure. To our surprise, we find that <i>k<sup>298</sup></i><font
SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">»</font>1100 s<sup>-1</sup><sub> </sub>for the bidentate
mono-methylmalonato complex and <i>k<sup>298</sup></i><font SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">»</font>10000
s<sup>-1</sup> for the bis-bidentate complex, which is much more reactive than
anticipated. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>Predicting Rates Using a Linear-Free-Energy Relation</u> </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Figure 2 we compare the rate coefficient for exchange of water in
the complexes with the overall equilibrium constant. Also plotted for comparison are the
rate coefficients predicted for water exchange between the bulk solution and the
inner-coordination sphere of Al(III)-phthalate and Al(III) methylmalonate complexes. Rate
coefficients are predicted for both the mono- and bis-bidentate complexes. These are
carboxylate complexes that mimic the carboxylate functionalities present in natural
organic matter. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These rate coefficients are determined at the most fundamental level of
real molecular motions and are extrapolatable to a wide range of processes if the
rate-controlling step in these reactions is dissociation of a metal-oxygen bond. We are
now exploring exchange on the Al<sub>13</sub>(O<sub>4</sub>)OH<sub>24</sub>(H<sub> 2</sub>O)<sub>12</sub><sup>7+</sup>(aq)
multimer, which has twelve <font SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">h</font><sup>1</sup>-OH<sub>2</sub>
sites, two sets of twelve µ<sub>2</sub>-OH groups and four µ<sub>4</sub>-oxo groups.
This complex was chosen because of its structural similarity to sites exposed by
truncation of the [010] surface of <font SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">g</font>-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(s)
or the [001] surface of Bayerite. The areal charge density on the multimer is <font
SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">»</font>10&nbsp; µmoles/m<sup>2</sup>, which compares well with
the 1-9 µmoles/m<sup>2</sup> charge densities on minerals such as bayerite at pH
values&lt;PZNPC. These Al<sub>13</sub>(O<sub>4</sub>)OH<sub>24</sub>(H<sub> 2</sub>O)<sub>12</sub><sup>7+</sup>(aq)
molecules in fact link together with over hours to form colloids initially with a
psuedo-spinel structure [<font SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">g</font>-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O]
and ultimately with the bayerite [ß-Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>] structure. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Objectives:</b> The goals of the project are to increase both the
data base and the fundamental understanding of the thermodynamics of volatile-bearing
mineral phases (amphiboles, micas, clays, zeolites, carbonates) important to surficial,
sedimentary, and shallow crustal processes. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Project Description:</b> Using high temperature solution
calorimetry, this research determines the enthalpies of formation of hydrous minerals and
carbonates. Systematics in energetics of ionic substitutions are sought in order to
predict the thermodynamics of complex multicomponent minerals. Mixing properties of mica,
amphibole, clay, zeolite, and carbonate solid solutions are also studied. The calorimetry
facility has moved from Princeton to the University of California at Davis. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Results:</b> <i>Carbonates:</i> Study of a largely disordered series
of synthetic ankerites (Mg,Fe)Ca(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and of more ordered natural
samples confirm significant differences in enthalpy between the two groups of materials.
These are consistent with an enthalpy of disordering of MgCa(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
of 20-25 kJ/mol and an enthalpy of disordering of FeCa(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> of
about 10 kJ/mol. The rather large enthalpy of disordering of dolomite is supported both by
the systematics of solid solution energetics derived by Davies and Navrotsky (1982) and by
a calorimetric study of a metastable apparently totally disordered CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
sample made from aqueous solution. The latter sample is energetically less stable than a
mixture of huntite CaMg<sub>3</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub> and Ca-rich dolomite to
which it decomposes on heating. The system SrCO<sub>3</sub>-CaCO<sub>3</sub> has been
studied by calorimetry. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>Zeolites:</i> Work on the Ca-zeolites (laumontite, leonhardite,
yugawaralite, wairakite) and their ion-exchanged forms has been published. The energetics
of ion exchange and hydration in other zeolites is under investigation. The energetics of
the Si = Al + Na substitution is similar in faujasites and aluminosilicate glasses. The
energetics of hydration of chabazites is being studied. Their heats of formation, for
anhydrous frameworks, appear similar to those of glasses of similar composition. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>Clays:</i> Drop solution calorimetry in molten lead borate at 702
ºC allowed us to redetermine the heat of formation of kaolinite and dickite in agreement
with Barany and Kelley (1961). The energetics of the polytypism of the kaolin minerals has
been extended to several differently crystallized kaolinites and the minerals nacrite and
halloysite. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Enthalpy of formation in the illite/smectite system has been
investigated for the first time. The samples studied, all natural, are mostly reference
clays from the Clay Minerals Society. They give a good coverage of the sedimentary
sequences with different stages of mixed layer compounds. However the various levels of
impurities, always found in natural samples, increase the uncertainty. To go further,
selected compositional series have been prepared. The enthalpy of formation at room
temperature and the heat capacity between 50 and 250ºC have been measured in a cation
exchanged smectite series between sodium and potassium. Recrystallization of smectite
under hydrothermal conditions permitted the synthesis of a mixed layer clay at constant
chemistry. This type of synthesis should allow better insight into diagenesis by applying
the thermochemical measurements now in progress. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sensitivity of drop solution calorimetry to the water adsorbed led
us to develop appropriate experimental methods. Additional experiments on water-clay
energetics are planned. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The electrochemical method provides a means of estimating thermodynamic
properties at the low temperatures that are characteristic of most soils and aquifers. At
these conditions, acid-solution calorimetry is not sufficiently accurate for determining
enthalpies of reaction, because CO<sub>2</sub> degasses slowly from an aqueous solution.
Solubility experiments are likewise difficult because secondary minerals typically
precipitate in a dissolution experiment, thereby complicating interpretation of the data.
Metastable equilibrium is much easier to achieve with the electrochemical cells that we
employ because the voltage measurements do not dramatically perturb the system, unlike
dissolution experiments where a significant fraction of the solid must be dissolved to
receive information. Thermodynamic data are also derived from the electrochemical cell
data directly, without a complicated model for solute speciation. Equilibrium in the cell
can be demonstrated through: (i) Nernstian response of the potential to changes in solute
activities; (ii) the absence of hysterisis in voltage-current plots for the cell; and
(iii) the rapid and reversible response of the cell voltage to temperature cycling. The
method is also demonstrably accurate, our estimated value of <font SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">D</font>&#131;G<sup>o

2kJ&#149;mol<sup>-1</sup> of the NBS values reported in Wagman et al., 1982 (<u>J. Phys.
Chem. Ref. Data</u><b> 11</b> [Supl. 2] 1-392. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A theoretical method for calculating lattice energies of
calcite-structure metal carbonates has been devised. By separating the lattice energy (<font
SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">D</font><i>U</i>) into polarization, electrostatic, and replusive
components, the calculation of <font SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">D</font><i>U</i> is done in a
step-wise fashion, whereby each of the three components of <font SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">D</font><i>U</i>
is first found as a function of the partial charge on oxygen (<i>Q<sub>oxy</sub></i>) in
each of the solid metal carbonates under investigation. The polarization component of <font
SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">D</font><i>U</i> is found through a two-step process. First, the
oxygen polarizabilities in the solid metal carbonates are computed via the Lorentz Local
Field Method, which requires crystal refractive indices as input. Next, a self-consistent
approach is employed to determine the dipole moment on oxygen while it resides in the
carbonate mineral. With this information at hand, the polarization contribution to <font
SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">D</font><i>U</i> can be found as a function of <i>Q<sub>oxy</sub></i>.
</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The determination of the electrostatic component of <font SIZE="2"
FACE="Symbol">D</font><i>U</i> is done by means of a coulombic point charge approach which
takes into account the change in the carbonate ion charge distribution as it transfers to
the crystal phase from the gas phase. The charge distribution of CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup><sub>(g)</sub>
is found via molecular-orbital calculations with Gaussian `94. Evaluation of the repulsive
segment of <font SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">D</font><i>U</i> is accomplished by means of the
Slater repulsive potential, which is also known as the Inverse Power Law.&nbsp; By
imposing an equilibrium condition on <font SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">D</font><i>U</i> with
respect to interionic separation distance, the value of the repulsive energy in each metal
carbonate is obtained as a function of <i>Q<sub>oxy</sub></i>. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With )<i>U</i> calculated as a function of <i>Q<sub>oxy</sub></i>,
Gaussian `94 is used for the determination of <i>Q<sub>oxy</sub></i> in each carbonate
mineral in order to assign a numerical value to <font SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol">D</font><i>U</i>.
After calculating<font SIZE="2" FACE="Symbol"> D</font><i>U</i> for a variety of
calcite-structure metal carbonates, the approach is extended to solid solutions of the

solid solutions by coupling the lattice energy calculation method of this work to
subregular solution models. </p>
