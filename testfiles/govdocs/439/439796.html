               <span class="abstract"> NO2 and dimethylether (DME) adsorption as well as DME and NO2 coadsorption on a transition metal-free &gamma;-alumina catalyst were investigated via in-situ transmission Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (in-situ FTIR), residual gas analysis (RGA) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) techniques.  NO2 adsorption at room temperature leads to the formation of surface nitrates and nitrites.  DME adsorption on the alumina surface at 300 K leads to molecularly adsorbed DME, molecularly adsorbed methanol and surface methoxides.  Upon heating the DME-exposed alumina to 500-600 K the surface is dominated by methoxide groups.  At higher temperatures methoxide groups are converted into formates.  At T &gt; 510 K formate decomposition takes place to form H2O(g) and CO(g).  DME and NO2 coadsorption at 423 K do not indicate a significant reaction between DME and NO2.  However, in similar experiments at 573 K, fast reaction occurs and the methoxides present at 573 K before the NO2 adsorption are converted into formates, simultaneously with the formation of isocyanates. Under these conditions, NCO can further be hydrolyzed into isocyanic acid or ammonia with the help of water which is generated during the formate formation, decomposition and/or NCO formation steps.</span>

               <span class="abstract">There has been recent debate regarding the role or influence of BaCO3 species on the performance or operation of Pt/BaO/Al2O3 model NOx storage/reduction (NSR) catalysts. This influence is primarily regarded as negative, but the extent of its impact is not clear. For this reason, the formation and stability of barium carbonate species on a Pt/BaO/Al2O3 model NSR catalyst were characterized using Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy. The catalyst sample was exposed to CO2, CO and CO + O2 at various temperatures, from 300K to &gt;500K. Bidentate carbonate species readily form under all conditions while, at higher temperatures, unidentate species were also observed and likely formed from bidentate species as a result of a change in their coordination to the oxide surface. Reaction of COx species with residual hydroxide species on the catalyst led to the formation of bicarbonates, and when the sample was exposed to CO at low temperature, formate species were also formed. These formate species decomposed at elevated temperatures and contributed to the formation of carbonates. H2O exposure resulted in the agglomeration of various COx-containing phases to larger particles.</span>

               <span class="abstract">Here we investigate isotope effects on the catalytic methanol synthesis reaction and the reactivity of copper-bound formate species in CO2-H2 atmospheres on Cu/SiO2 catalysts by simultaneous IR and MS measurements, both steady-state and transient. Studies of isotopic variants (H/D, 12C/13C) reveal that bidentate formate dominates the copper surface at steady state.  The steady-state formate coverages of HCOO (in 6 bar 3:1 H2:CO2) and DCOO (in D2:CO2) are similar and the steady-state formate coverages in both systems decrease by ~80% from 350 K to 550 K. Over the temperature range 413K &ndash; 553K, the steady-state methanol synthesis rate shows a weak H/D isotope effect (1.05 &plusmn; 0.05) with somewhat higher activation energies in H2:CO2 (79 kJ/mole) than D2:CO2 (71 kJ/mole) over the range 473K-553K.  The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) rates are higher than methanol synthesis and also shows a weak positive H/D isotope effect with higher activation energy for H2/CO2 than D2/CO2 (108 vs. and 102 kJ/mole).  The reactivity of the resulting formate species in 6 bar H2, 6 bar D2 and 6 bar Ar is strongly dominated by decomposition back to CO2 and H2. H2 and D2 exposure compared to Ar do not enhance the formate decomposition rate.  The decomposition profiles on the supported catalyst deviate from first order decay, indicating distributed surface reactivity. The average decomposition rates are similar to values previously reported on single crystals. The average activation energies for formate decomposition are 90 &plusmn; 17 kJ/mole for HCOO and 119 &plusmn; 11 kJ/mole for DCOO.  By contrast to the catalytic reaction rates, the formate decomposition rate shows a strong H/D kinetic isotope effect (H/D ~ 8 at 413K), similar to previously observed values on Cu(110).</span>

              <span class="title">"Understanding Practical Catalysts Using a Surface Science Approach:  The Importance of Strong Interaction between BaO and Al2O3 in NOx Storage Materials."</span>
              <cite>Journal of Physical Chemistry C 111(41):14942-14944. doi:10.1021/jp0763376</cite>
              
               <a href="javascript:void(0)">Abstract</a>
               <span class="abstract">Modern surface science techniques have been commonly applied to understand issues arising from practical catalytic systems.[1-4]  However, the applicability of most of the results obtained from model systems has been limited, due, primarily, to the vastly different conditions studies on model and practical systems are carried out (catalyst composition, reaction conditions etc.).[5, 6]  Therefore, the need to conduct experiments on compositionally similar systems (model and practical) is necessary to obtain valuable information on the workings of real catalysts.  In this communication we demonstrate the utility of surface science studies on model catalysts in understanding the properties of high surface area, BaO-based NOx storage-reduction (NSR) catalysts.[7]  We present evidence for the facile formation of surface barium aluminate-like species even at very low coverages of BaO.  This Ba-aluminate layer, however, can react with NO2 resulting in the formation of a bulk-like Ba(NO3)2 phase. In order to construct model catalysts that are representative of the practical NOx storage systems, we first needed to estimate the BaO covareges on the high surface area catalysts.  Since the publication of the work by Fanson et al.[8], BaO loadings of 8 &ndash; 10 wt.% on a &gamma;-alumina support (200 m2/g) have been regarded as corresponding to one monolayer (ML) coverage, based on the unit cell size of bulk BaO.  The coverage equivalent of one ML, however, was significantly underestimated.  Assuming complete spreading of the BaO layer and using a Ba&ndash;O distance of ~ 2.77 &Aring; (one unit of BaO occupies 1.53 &times; 10-19 m2), 10 wt.% loading of BaO would cover only about 1/3 of the alumina surface.  Table 1 shows our calculated estimates of two-dimensional BaO coverages as a function of loading on a &#61543;-Al2O3 surface (200 m2/g) based on the lattice parameters of bulk BaO[9] (5.54 &Aring;).  Based on these values, for our model system studies we prepared BaO/Al2O3/NiAl(110) materials in which the BaO coverages were very close to those of 4, 8, and 20 wt.% BaO/&gamma;-Al2O3 high surface area catalysts used in prior studies.</span>

               <span class="abstract">The structure of an ordered, ultra-thin Al2O3 film grown on a NiAl(110) single-crystal surface and its interaction with D2O were studied by low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEISS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS).  LEISS demonstrated that the surface was terminated by an oxygen layer, and TPD data of adsorbed D2O revealed that most of the water molecularly adsorbed onto Al2O3/NiAl(110).  However, we observed that a small amount of water molecules dissociated during adsorption and/or TPD measurements, and as a consequence the alumina film thickness increased after water adsorption/desorption.  These results suggest that atomic oxygen and/or hydroxyl species, which are formed by dissociation of water, interact with sub-surface aluminum atoms through defects sites and cause the increase in the alumina film thickness.  In addition, due to the weak interaction between adsorbed water molecules and the alumina film, a few monolayer of water can be transformed from amorphous solid water (ASW) to crystalline ice (CI) phase, as it was seen by IRAS.</span>

               <span class="abstract">CO2 is known to adsorb onto clay and other minerals when a significant atmospheric pressure is present. We have found that CO2 can also adsorb onto some clays when the CO2 partial pressure is effectively zero under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) if cooled to the surface temperatures of the icy satellites of Jupiter and Saturn. The strength of adsorption and the spectral characteristics of the adsorbed CO2 infrared (IR) &nu;3 absorption band near 4.25 &mu;m depend on the composition and temperature of the adsorbent. CO2 remains adsorbed onto the clay mineral montmorillonite for &gt;10 s of min when exposed to a vacuum of &sim;1&times;10&minus;8 Torr at &sim;125 K. CO2 does not adsorb onto serpentine, goethite, or palagonite under these conditions. A small amount may adsorb onto kaolinite. When heated above 150 K under vacuum, the CO2 desorbs from the montmorillonite within a few minutes. The &nu;3 absorption band of CO2 adsorbed onto montmorillonite at 125 K is similar to that of the CO2 detected on the saturnian and Galilean satellites and is markedly different from CO2 adsorbed onto montmorillonite at room temperature. We infer the adsorption process is physisorption and postulate that this mechanism may explain the presence and spectral characteristics of the CO2 detected in the surfaces of these outer satellites.</span>

A suite of complementary techniques such as DRS-UV/Vis, BET, 1H-NMR, XRD, and TEM were used to study the structural properties of the supported metal oxides, and probe reactions such as  2-butanol dehydration and ethanol partial oxidation were used to demonstrate the potential advantages of the ALD prepared catalysts.  Specifically, highly dispersed oxides of titanium, molybdenum, and tungsten oxide on mesoporous silica were synthesized using the ALD method.  It is also demonstrated that attainment of high dispersions of vanadium oxide on mesoporous silica requires the presence of at least a single layer of titanium oxide due to the well-known poor interaction between vanadia and silica.  The highly dispersed catalysts prepared here by ALD methods exhibited superior catalytic performance relative to those prepared using conventional incipient wetness impregnation.</span>

The XRD together with TEM, 51V-NMR, Raman, FTIR and DRS-UV-Vis results showed that the vanadia species are extremely well dispersed onto the surface of the mesoporous support; the dispersion being stable upon thermal treatments up to 400 &deg;C.  Studies of the catalytic activity of these materials were performed using the partial oxidation of ethanol as a probe reaction.
