<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Objectives:</b> This project concerns chemical 
interactions between metal ions in aqueous solution 
and oxide surfaces representative of those found in 
the Earth's crust.  These &quot;sorption&quot; reactions partition 
the metal between fluid and solid phases and must be 
understood at a molecular level to develop 
quantitative geochemical understanding of mineral surfaces and 
the macroscopic models required to predict the fate of 
contaminants in the environment. Our objectives are 
to (1) characterize sorption reactions by determining 
composition, molecular-scale structure, and bonding of 
the surface complexes produced using direct sorption 
measurements and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption 
fine structure (XAFS), X-ray photoelectron (XPS), and 
UV/Vis/IR spectroscopies, (2) investigate how these 
properties are affected by the solid surface and 
aqueous phase composition, and (3) develop molecular-level 
and macroscopic models of sorption processes.

</b>  (1) <i>Grazing-Incidence XAFS Studies of Co(II) and Pb(II) 
Sorption Complexes on Single Crystal 
<img SRC="alpha.jpg" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="6">-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>: </i>Using an apparatus we developed for fluorescence XAFS of 
adsorbates on wet single crystal surfaces in 
grazing-incidence geometry, we examined sorption complexes of 
Co(II) and Pb(II) on <img SRC="alpha.jpg" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="6">-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (0001) and (1-102) surfaces 
and of Co(II) on TiO<sub>2</sub> (rutile) (110) and (001) surfaces. 
As an example of our results, we found that Pb(II) 
forms outer-sphere (OS) complexes on 
<img SRC="alpha.jpg" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="6">-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (0001) but inner-sphere (IS) complexes on 
<img SRC="alpha.jpg" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="6">-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (1-102).  In contrast, Co(II) forms about equal concentrations 
of IS complexes on both surfaces of

and dominantly to tetradentate sites on the (1-102) surface. 
 These differences are explained using a 
bond-valence model that accounts for structural differences on 
the alumina surfaces and differences in coordination 
chemistry of Co(II) and Pb(II) in solution. These results 
provide the first direct structural evidence that 
different surfaces of an oxide can adsorb cations in 
different modes.

IS complexes at pH 6-7 and sorption densities <img SRC="cap.jpg" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="26"> of 
0.5 to 5.2 mmoles/m<sup>2</sup>. Pb(II) sorbs on goethite and 
hematite as mononuclear bidentate complexes to edges 
of FeO<sub>6</sub> octahedra. Our bond-valence model and 
XAFS results suggest that Pb(II) sorbs primarily 
at unprotonated surface sites. Hydrolysis of Pb(II) 
appears to be the primary source of proton release during 
Pb(II) sorption. Absence of dimeric Pb(II) complexes on 
iron oxides and their presence on 
<img SRC="alpha.jpg" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="6">-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> may be related to differences in 
Al(O,OH)<sub>6</sub> and FeO<sub>6</sub> octahedral

sorption of Co(II) on

capable of simulating uptake data alone. In this system, as 
for Co(II) on <img SRC="alpha.jpg" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="6">-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, XAFS-derived near-neighbor 
Co stoichiometry requires multinuclear surface 
complexes, however, and thus rules out strictly mononuclear 
models. Our recent observation of mixed (Co,Al) 
hydroxide precipitates in undersaturated solutions 
reinforces assumptions that precipitation is an important 
sorption reaction. A small set of inner-sphere, bidentate, 
mononuclear sorption reactions, dimeric and 
monomeric multinuclear complexes, and 
Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> precipitation approximate uptake and XAFS data well.

Sorption Complexes</i>: U(VI) sorbed onto kaolinite was studied 
using XAFS spectroscopy to develop a molecular-level 
understanding of sorption of U(VI) by clays in soils 
and sediments. A parallel XAFS study of U in 
crystalline solids demonstrated the accuracy of structural 
information derived from U XAFS, including the 
second coordination shell around U. Sorption complexes 
on kaolinite contained the uranyl moiety bonded in 
IS mode, surrounded by five equatorial oxygens. At 
pH 6-7 in air, mononuclear U species dominate.  At pH 
7-7.5 in air, small multinuclear U complexes 
dominate, with numbers of U atoms similar to those of 
dominant species in the corresponding aqueous solution. 
With CO<sub>2</sub> absent and pH 7-8, multinuclear complexes 
also dominate.

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Objectives:</b> The objectives of this project are 
to describe and document the geometry of 
opening-mode fracture networks and clusters in sedimentary rock, 
 understand the mechanics of their development in 
relationship to faults and folds, and develop a 
sound methodology for prediction of spatial variations of 
permeability in fractured aquifers and reservoirs using 
an integrated program of field mapping, laboratory 
simulation, and theoretical analysis.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Project Description:</b> The principal elements of 
the project are to (1) investigate the variations in 
orientation and distribution of fracture sets near normal 
faults and characterize their geometric and fluid flow 
properties, (2) investigate the mechanisms of fracture 
clustering and construct conceptual and mechanical 
models for the impact of fracture clusters on the 
development of faults and folds in sedimentary rocks, (3) design 
and carry out laboratory experiments using a 
brittle-coating technique to investigate the development of 
fracture networks in folded layered materials, (4) 
design and carry out laboratory experiments on 
three-dimensional fracture propagation in blocks of PMMA 
under mixed-mode loading to understand the 
relationships between loading and complex fracture geometries, 
and (5) develop a computer code for predicting the 
connectivity and spatial density of fractures in a

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Fracture Clusters in the Perturbed Stress Field 
Near Normal Faults
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Results:</b> Over the past year, we focused on the 
characterization of joints that form approximately 
orthogonal to normal faults. Classic Andersonian 
theory invokes a stress regime that produces joints parallel 
to the strike of faults; however, this theory fails to 
incorporate the influence of the fault on the stress field. As 
a fault grows, the surrounding stress field is perturbed 
so that joints may form with orientations different 
from Andersonian predictions.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At Arches National Park, Utah, field evidence, 
such as joint densities and age relationships, supports 
the hypothesis that joint growth was driven by the 
stresses induced by faulting. The joints are nearly 
perpendicular to the faults and are steeply dipping. The spacing 
of the joints is on the order of the thickness of the unit 
in which they are contained (Moab Member of the 
Entrada Formation), and the joints frequently occur as 
clusters of several closely-spaced joints.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Using a boundary element method computer 
program and principles of linear elastic fracture 
mechanics, the stress perturbation around a normal fault 
does indeed predict joint growth at high angles to faults 
in the vicinity of the fault tips, where stress 
concentrations are highest. Three-dimensional rendering of 
the stress field provides an informative demonstration 
of the spatial variation in the stress field and 
associated joints around normal faults.

Joint Zones</b> 
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Results:</b> Faults with offsets ranging from ~1cm 
to ~150m were mapped in the Valley of Fire State 
Park, southern Nevada. These maps include the 
geometric and physical attributes of the associated fractures 
and provide a large data base for conceptual models of 
faults and fractures in sandstone and their hydraulic 
properties. Fracture localization, produced by shearing of  
 preexisting joint zones, results in faults with a 
highly damaged and fragmented core. The maps enable 
identification of fragmentation mechanisms and 
characteristic fracture geometries associated with 
accumulated slip. Fragmentation occurs at irregularities in the 
trace of joints subjected to shear, at sheared joint 
intersections, and in the span between overlapping 
echelon sheared joint segments.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two classes of faults produced from sheared 
joint zones have been identified. One type is associated 
with right stepping joint zones sheared in a left sense or 
left stepping joints sheared in a right sense. In these 
cases fragmentation occurs by failure of intervening rock 
in compression. The other fault type is associated 
with right stepping joint zones sheared in a right sense 
or left stepping joints sheared in a left sense. 
Fragmentation in these cases is produced by tensile failure of 
rock spans between sheared joints.

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Numerical Modeling of Multilayered Flexures 
with Fractures
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Results:</b> Two mechanisms that produce joint 
clusters in folds are bending and bedding plane slip. 
Therefore, fractures are likely to be associated spatially 
with regions of greater curvature and with larger slip 
gradients on bedding plane faults. Bedding planes were mapped through the thickness of the aeolian 
Navajo Formation of East Kaibab Monocline, Utah, and 
the occurrence of joints related to bedding plane slip 
and fold curvature were documented. Slip along 
bedding planes, as evidenced by joint clusters oblique to 
bedding, develops in the center of the formation. 
Joints perpendicular to bedding and parallel to the fold 
axis form near the synclinal hinge.
<td COLSPAN="1">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Numerical experiments used the boundary 
element method to examine bending of a layer flexed to 
match the Navajo Formation at Hackberry Canyon. Both 
uniform and observed distributions of frictional layers 
were modeled. The numerical models include inelastic 
frictional slip and the development of opening-mode 
fractures from points of stress concentration. Slip 
along horizontal frictional interfaces develops in the 
center of the layer and opening-mode fractures related to 
curvature form within the anticlinal and synclinal 
hinges of the fold. Thus, the first-order numerical results 
match field observations.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same numerical code was used to 
investigate frictional bedding plane slip in the initial stages of 
fault-related folding. Results show how fold shape 
depends on dip of the underlying fault; asymmetric 
anticlines are produced under contraction boundary 
conditions and asymmetric synclines are produced under 
extension. At depths as shallow as 1 km there is no 
significant difference between fold amplitudes in the 
hanging wall and the footwall. The presence of frictional 
bedding planes near fault tips encourages development 
of fault flats from fault ramps.

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Objectives:</b> Objectives are to determine the 
dehydration rate of laumontite and its effect on the 
frictional rheology of laumontite.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Project Description:</b> Two processes of 
enormous economic consequence occur within the upper to 
middle crust: (1) the formation, migration, entrapment, and 
degradation of hydrocarbons and (2) hazardous 
seismicity.  Substantial scientific evidence suggests that 
both these processes are influenced by devolatilization 
reactions during diagenesis; however, surprisingly 
few laboratory studies have been conducted on 
materials actively undergoing low-grade metamorphism or 
diagenesis.  Because of this, there exists no suitable 
basis for understanding the rates at which 
devolatilization occurs and what effects this process has on 
deformation at shallow to moderate depths in the crust. 
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are conducting a coordinated deformation 
and kinetic study of an important devolatilization 
reaction, the breakdown of laumontite.  Laumontite is a 
common zeolite whose equilibrium phase relations 
and room-temperature frictional behavior are well 
understood.  Besides serving as a model system for 
more complicated rocks, laumontite is an important 
mineral in its own right, particularly for hydrocarbon fields 
in sandstones and for fault zones in the crust.  
Hydrostatic experiments are being conducted to investigate the 
kinetics and mechanism of laumontite dehydration, 
and triaxial deformation experiments will enable 
characterization of the effect of differential stress on the 
reaction and the effect of synkinematic dehydration on the

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">mechanical behavior of rock. We anticipate results 
of significant import for hydrocarbon exploration and 
recovery and for understanding the strength and 
seismic potential of crustal fault zones.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Results:</b> We have determined the rate and 
mechanism of the laumontite &amp;<img SRC="great.jpg" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="11">lig; wairakite + 
H<sub>2</sub>O reaction in experiments as long as three months at 
P<sub>H2O</sub> = 100 MPa and temperatures of 350°_450°C. At 
350°_400°C, nucleation occurred on the smallest 
laumontite fragments in the starting material. Growth proceeded 
by the dissolution of large laumontite grains, 
transport within the fluid, and reprecipitation of 
euhedral-subhedral wairakite. At 425° and 450°C, each 
sample contains two product phases, wairakite and an 
unidentified plagioclase-like phase. The plagioclase-like 
silicate is stabilized by the uptake of Na and formed 
early as ~10 mu-wide skeletal grains along laumontite 
grain boundaries. The wairakite grains subsequently 
nucleated and grew into large laumontite grains.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nucleation rates varied from 
&gt;10<sup>7</sup> wairakite grains per square meter of 
laumontite surface per second at 425°C to

temperatures the volumetric nucleation rate is

1.5x10<sup>-11</sup> m/s at 350°C to

can be fit with an apparent activation energy of 72 ±             
 13 kJ/mole and a pre-exponential &quot;interface jump 
distance&quot; of ~1 x 10<sup>-18</sup> m. These rates are comparable 
to those predicted by Walther and Wood to 
characterize interface-controlled reactions in silicates under

indicates that the rate-limiting step in the transformation of 
laumontite to wairakite under natural conditions 
cannot be interface-controlled growth under

heating rate, rate of fluid transport, or fluid activity.  We 
have completed nine friction experiments on laumontite

Sliding rates have been varied between 0.01 and 1.0

effective pressure of 100 MPa. All experiments so 
far are baseline measurements of the variations in 
laumontite friction with increasing temperature in the 
absence of transformation. At room temperature the strength 
of the laumontite gouge follows Byerlee's law, as 
expected, but at 350°_425°C the coefficient of 
friction is the highest ever measured for a silicate,

designed to reveal the deformation/transformation

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Objectives:</b> The objectives of this research are 
to (1) develop methods of attenuation estimation 
for crosswell seismic and sonic log data and (2) 
interpret the attenuation estimates, along with velocity data, 
for in situ reservoir properties.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Project Description:</b> Attenuation 
imaging is possible using the frequency-shift dispersion 
method, where the downshift in the centroid frequency of a 
seismic wavelet is used as projection data in 
tomographic inversion. This is analogous to using travel time 
for velocity imaging. Frequency shift data are less 
sensitive to effects that severely contaminate 
amplitudes which might otherwise be used to estimate 
attenuation. If attenuation is caused by friction between pore 
fluids and the pore walls, then attenuation measurements 
may be useful as indirect measurements of fluid 
permeability. Travel time tomography algorithms will be 
adapted to invert the frequency-shift data for local 
attenuation, and, finally, the attenuation images will be 
interpreted, cooperatively with other data, for in situ 
permeability near and between boreholes. The project makes 
extensive use of synthetic modeling of waves in 
viscoelastic and poroelastic media and real field data from 
the crosshole and sonic logging geometries.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Results:</b> A model that relates the integrated 
attenuation and the frequency shifts has been found. For 
a constant-Q model and a signal spectrum that can be fit
<td COLSPAN="1">
<td COLSPAN="1" ROWSPAN="2" HEIGHT="392" WIDTH="247" VALIGN="TOP">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">to a Gaussian distribution, the integrated 
attenuation equals the frequency-shift divided by the variance 
of the radiated spectrum. To verify this model, 
synthetic tests were needed. Since the frequency shift 
method uses information on dispersion, purely numerical 
modeling methods (e.g., finite differences) could not 
be used. We developed a semi-analytical modeling 
method and the corresponding computer codes to simulate 
the complete viscoelastic wave field in radially 
layered media. This forward modeling method is efficient 
and accurate and has no grid dispersion. Complete 
crosshole seismic surveys are simulated and used for 
synthetic attenuation tomography. Inversion results reveal 
that the frequency shift method is capable of imaging 
the attenuation distribution. Initial tests on field data 
also show that the attenuation tomograms exhibit good 
correlation with the geological structures. 
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also investigated the effects of scattering 
from thin layers on the frequency shifts. We found that 
geometrical spreading caused by refraction around 
complicated boreholes is highly frequency-dependent 
(i.e., dispersive) at high logging frequencies. The 
apparent spreading factor (1/z<sup>p </sup>with p&lt;1, p=1, or p&gt;1 for 
damaged, simple, and flushed boreholes, respectively) 
alters the frequency shifts in a way that 
significantly affects the estimation of intrinsic attenuation from 
the logging geometry.

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Objectives:</b> The objective of this project is to 
develop a fundamental understanding of seismicity 
associated with energy production. 
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Project Description: </b> Earthquakes are known 
to be associated with oil, gas, and geothermal energy 
production.  The goals of the project are to develop  
physical models that predict when seismicity is likely 
to occur and  to determine to what extent these 
earthquakes can be used to infer conditions within  energy 
reservoirs.  Early work focused on earthquakes induced 
by oil and gas extraction, which we were able to 
demonstrate are caused by  poroelastic stressing.  
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our present work is focused on two problems: 
(1) earthquakes within geothermal fields, such as The 
Geysers in northern California and (2) fundamental 
physics of earthquake nucleation, including effects 
of dilatancy, rate and state-dependent friction,  and 
shear heating. The former has involved modeling thermoelastic and poroelastic effects of 
geothermal production and water reinjection, as well as Global 
Positioning System (GPS) measurements of 
deformation within and around The Geysers. The latter has 
involved the development of  constitutive laws for 
dilatancy based on laboratory data and theoretical and 
numerical analyses of the stability of frictional  sliding 
under conditions appropriate for crustal faulting.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Results: </b>We have developed a simple model of 
the stresses induced by the injection of  cold water into 
a highly permeable fault zone within a geothermal 
reservoir.   Pore pressures within the fault zone depend 
on the mass flow rate of injected fluid, duration of 
injection, and product of permeability and fault zone thick
<td COLSPAN="1">
<td COLSPAN="1" HEIGHT="448" WIDTH="247" VALIGN="TOP">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ness (kh). Maximum pore pressures are on the order 
of 2 to 3 MPa above ambient for injection rates  of 10 
kg/s,  kh = 1011 m<sup>3</sup> (typical values for The Geysers) and 
injection times of 10 years or less.  Advective cooling 
of rock adjacent to the fault zone induces 
thermoelastic stresses.  The thermoelastic reduction in 
compressive stress normal to the fault zone is expected to 
weaken the fault against frictional sliding.  For a 
temperature contrast between the injected water and initial rock 
temperatures of 200°C (appropriate for The Geysers), 
the maximum reduction in effective normal stress 
across the fracture is on the order of 10s of MPa.  The 
thermal stress decreases with increasing distance from the 
borehole, eventually becoming negative (compressive). 
The result that thermoelastic stresses dominate pore 
pressure changes is true even when rapid volume 
changes due to heating and boiling of the injectate are 
taken into account.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Observations of surface subsidence and 
horizontal strain can help constrain the distribution of 
strains within the reservoir due to changes in temperature 
and pore-pressure.  In 1994 and 1995, 40 geodetic 
monuments within The Geysers geothermal field were 
reoccupied with GPS receivers.  Precision is 
sub-centimeter in the horizontal coordinates and 1-2 cm in the 
vertical.  Displacements between 1994 and 1995 are 
significant at the 95% confidence level and 
indicate subsidence within the reservoir as well as 
significant horizontal deformation.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have developed constitutive laws for 
dilatant fault gouges that include rate-dependent effects.

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Objectives:</b>  The objectives of the research are 
to (1) relate seismic characteristics of hydrocarbon 
reservoirs and groundwater aquifers to rock, soil, and 
pore-fluid properties and (2) apply the results to the 
design and interpretation of in situ seismic measurements 
to obtain subsurface fluid saturation, flow description, 
and flow monitoring.  The research program involves 
laboratory measurements, theoretical modeling, and in 
situ field studies.  It spans several projects.

</b> 
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Project Description:</b>  Conduct a 
high resolution shallow seismic refraction and reflection 
experiment with repeated profiling of every 20 minutes to 1.5 
hour to investigate the seismic response of water table 
excursions (and the air-saturated layer above the 
water table) in beach sand due to ocean tide.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Results:</b>  It has been found that a low velocity 
layer exists right above the fully saturated sand layer 
and right below the near-surface dry sand. This low 
velocity layer is caused by the relatively high density of 
the almost saturated sand, where only small amounts 
of gas are present, and its low compressibility, which 
is close to that of the dry sand. Thus, small gas 
bubbles trapped in the flooded sand strongly affect the 
system's seismic response. The history of water level 
variation is a key control of the seismic response. The 
results can be used to map water table from which both 
subsurface flow patterns and relative permeability can 
ultimately be obtained.

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Project Description:</b>  Investigate the seismic 
and sonic effects of the topology of fluid distribution 
in porous rocks, as applied to various processes of 
pore fluid replacement during drilling, well 
completion, hydrocarbon recovery, and also geological 
fluid migration.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Results: </b> Whereas Gassmann's equation can 
be used for perfectly homogeneous rock systems, 
even slight lithologic inhomogeneity (e.g., clay content 
spatial variation) may lead to significant saturation 
inhomogeneity (or patchiness) where Gassmann's 
equation is not directly applicable.  When saturation is 
patchy, newly derived modified equations have to be used 
to predict saturation from seismic and to calculate 
rock-frame properties from well logs.  Accounting for 
saturation inhomogeneity is especially important in 
the interpretation of repeated surface and crosswell 
seismic data and sonic well logs for monitoring fluid 
recovery in two or three phase reservoirs.

the solid phase (such as diagenetic cement or gas 
hydrates) in the pore space.

Permeability, on the other hand, is not very sensitive to 
filling the grain contacts (at high porosity) and shows 
only small decrease with decreasing porosity.  In the

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Objectives:</b>   A research program has been 
initiated to study the surface reactivity of pyrite, the 
most abundant metal sulfide on Earth.  A unique aspect 
of this research program is that it integrates 
experimental observations made using low-temperature 
aqueous techniques and modern surface science probes. 
Low-temperature aqueous techniques, such as 
electrophoresis, provide insight into the overall acid-base 
behavior, charge development, and sorption onto the 
surface. Modern surface probes, such as high resolution 
electron loss spectroscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, 
low energy electron diffraction, and temperature 
programmed desorption, provide molecular level 
information on the geometric and electronic structure of 
both the chemisorbed molecule and adsorbing surface. 
With these probes it is possible, for example, to 
determine the nature of surface groups that are responsible for 
the acid-base reactions and charge development 
observed in electrophoresis experiments.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Project Description: </b> In the first stage of 
this project, the focus will be on understanding the 
charge development on pyrite and the interaction of its 
surface with water.  Electrophoresis will be used to 
determine the charge development of pyrite in solutions 
with known concentrations of inorganic and organic species. 
 Modern surface science probes will be used to 
interrogate the molecular structure and thermal chemistry 
of adsorbed species on pyrite. These surface science 
studies encompass two types of experimental studies.   
The objective of the first type of surface science study is 
to investigate the reactivity of an atomically clean &quot;as
<td COLSPAN="1">
<td COLSPAN="1" HEIGHT="420" WIDTH="247" VALIGN="TOP">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">grown&quot; surface of pyrite, in the ultra high 
vacuum (UHV) environment, toward a variety of molecular 
reactants.  Naturally occurring samples of pyrite will 
be cleaned using a technique developed in our 
research group (Chaturvedi et al., 1996, <i>Am. 
Min</i>. 81, 261-264).  This cleaning technique allows us to study the 
reactivity of atomically clean cubic and octahedral 
surfaces of pyrite and avoids the more extensive structural 
and chemical changes associated with cleaving, cutting, 
and polishing samples. The interaction of the clean 
surfaces with selected molecules (e.g., 
H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>S, CH<sub>3</sub>OH) 
will be investigated in UHV using the array of electron 
spectroscopic and thermal desorption techniques.  The 
goal of these experiments will be to develop an atomic 
level view of the structure and reaction chemistry of 
the chemisorbed species and pyrite surface.    The 
second type of study investigates the surface of  pyrite 
after exposure to solutions of known composition.  
These experiments provide us with a bridge between the 
electrophoresis experiments and the UHV studies.  To 
conduct this type of experiment, a transfer cell has 
been designed that allows exposure of a well-defined 
pyrite crystal to a solution at room temperature and 
pressure, followed by transfer of the sample into the UHV 
environment for analysis with surface science probes.  
With this transfer cell it is possible to investigate the 
change in surface composition as a function of solution 
composition.  Our choice of  solution compositions for 
these studies will be guided by the results of the 
electrophoresis experiments.

radioisotopes, with abundances and concentrations 
of 10<sup>-12</sup> and 10<sup>-22</sup> in modern

environment, including dating of polar ice and very old groundwater, 
ocean circulation, and modern water flow patterns. 
Cosmogenic <sup>81</sup>Kr (2.1x10<sup>5</sup> year half-life) can date 
events in the 50,000- to 1,000,000-year time period, while 
anthropogenic <sup>85</sup>Kr (10.8-year half-life) is useful in 
tracing events during the last 50 years.  Neither isotope 
is accessible by accelerator mass spectrometry.  A 
few measurements of <sup>85</sup>Kr from 200-liter 
water samples, using decay counting, have been demonstrated.  
The only <sup>81</sup>Kr measurements from natural samples to

detection limit of 100 <sup>85</sup>Kr atoms had been 
demonstrated earlier in the final mass spectrometer.  Required still 
is characterization of the efficiency, accuracy, and

complete redesign of step (4); and improvement to the laser

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Results:</b>  Most of the effort this past year has 
been to steps (3), (4), and (5).  The first enrichment 
system (3) uses a 15-inch velocity filter and plasma ion 
source in a closed, gas recirculating system.  The 
ion-source controller has been rebuilt, a Hall-Effect probe 
installed, an isotope dilution calibration system designed, and 
the ion path completely realigned.  These changes 
should significantly enhance accuracy, stability, reliability, 
and safety.  Gold coating of the rods in the 
quadrupole-based second enrichment system (4) and redesign of the 
collector and detection hardware should breathe a 
little more life into this obsolescent system until the 
design of the magnetic sector-based replacement is finished. 
 The resonance ionization time-of-flight mass 
spectrometer (5) has a significantly improved data 
acquisition system, a completely new sample introduction 
system, and enhanced vacuum system.
