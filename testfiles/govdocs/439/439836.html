<TR><TD><STRONG>Activity and Objective</STRONG></TD><TD><STRONG>Considerations</STRONG></TD><TD><STRONG>Product</STRONG></TD></TR>


<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Project Statement</B><BR>
To establish a clear understanding of the proposed undertaking and what it intends to accomplish.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP> What is the purpose of the development (resource conservation and/or interpretation, recreation, resort, research)? Who is it intended for and who is involved? (List the owner, the operator, the intended user, local community and special interest groups, the insurer, the financier). What is its anticipated effect on any known or anticipated cultural or natural resources at the site?  What is its anticipated effect on locally available resources, economy and culture?</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>A complete statement of accountability will be available to the: public prior to commencement of the project.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Site Survey</B><BR>
To identify and quantify evident existing cultural resources at the site and to make predictions about the possible presence of buried or submerged resources; to allow informed decisions about the effects of the development on these  resources.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Cultural resources are primarily objects or sites having historic, prehistoric, or sacred        
significance. Such resources exist both on land and under water (submerged cultural resources). Shipwrecks are a prime example of submerged cultural resources.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Inventories of cultural resources (e.g.  cultural site surveys, historical base maps) will be produced and recommendations made for further testing if the probability of nonevident cultural resources is determined to exist.</TD></TR>
 
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Determination of Significance</B><BR>
To establish a context against which a proposed development and resulting preservation or mitigation alternative may be weighed and justified.<BR>
<BR>
NOTE: After priorities of significance are determined, development of alternatives can begin. Not all alternatives lead to development; some will be minimal approaches that could result in a "do nothing" alternative.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>The significance of a cultural resource is usually evaluated on the basis of
<UL>
<LI>association with historic events or persons<BR>
<LI>cultural association<BR>
<LI>artistic or scientific merit<BR>
<LI>importance as part of a larger resource, such as a historic district, landscape or viewshed.
</UL>
The significance of a cultural resource may be rated according to its geographical range
of importance.  In general, the broader this range is, the more important the resource is
considered to be. The levels of significance are as follows:<BR>
<UL>
<I>Local:</I> significant to a local community or cultural group (i.e., vernacular architecture)<BR>
<I>Regional:</I> significant within a regional (state, territory) context<BR>
<I>National:</I> significant to national history<BR>
<I>Global:</I> significant to all humanity (world heritage sites)
</UL></TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Once the existing and historic setting are clearly understood, they must be evaluated both  by professionals and other interested parties. As a result of this evaluation process, those resources that are determined to be significant at one or more levels are usually nominated to a registry of cultural resources. In the United States, there are national, state, and local registers of historic places.<BR>
<BR>
Nomination of resources meeting the criteria is, in many cases, required by law, particularly if the property is in public ownership or receives public funding. Once nominated resources have been accepted and formally listed on one or more of the registers, sanctions may be imposed for their damage or destruction. Such properties 
may qualify for various benefits that could aid in their preservation. Listing on these registers may produce
peripheral benefits such as increased tourism.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Development of
Preservation Alternatives</B><BR>To explore what can and should be done to the resource and determine a range of possible alternatives.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Certain factors are inherent in each cultural resource that should be considered when  
developing a range of alternatives.<BR>
<BR>                                                  
<I>Significance</I> - Do existing cultural resources have such significance that development
cannot be warranted or can the development be accommodated within acceptable limits?<BR>
<BR>
<I>Location</I> - is the cultural resource in an environmentally sensitive area where increased
visitation or the preservation work itself might be detrimental?<BR>
<BR>
<I>Physical Condition of the Resource</I> - is the proposed alternative technically feasible? What
level of technology would be required? Consider the nature of the resource. Some   
structures were not designed to last; to try and preserve them in their original. 
environment would be impossible.  Even some very durable structures are not sustainable.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Integrity of the Resource</I> - Authentic ruins are preferable to accurate restorations;        
similarly, a restoration has more integrity than a complete reconstruction. Can the work
be undone at sometime in the future with no loss of resource integrity?<BR>
<BR>
<I>Carrying Capacity of the Resource</I> - if the existing resource must be if altered to preserve
it, the limits of acceptable change have already been reached or exceeded.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Impacts on the Local Community and Surrounding Environment</I> - Does the development
prevent or restrict the traditional use of the land or resources by local cultures? Would
treatments necessary to preserve the resource introduce toxic and nonbiodegradible            
products into the environment?  Would the proposed treatment require the use of
nonrenewable materials?<BR>
<BR>
There are certain intrinsic factors that should be considered when developing a range of
preservation alternatives. These include:<BR>                           
<BR>
<I>Ownership</I> - if the property is owned by government or trust agencies, certain policies
and standards must be followed. The same is true if such agencies fund either the
preservation work or the development.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Visitors</I> - What are the expectations of the visitors (i.e., is complete restoration of a
cultural resource an appropriate alternative where the primary purpose of visitation to the
area is that of physical recreation)? Are there health or safety problems in presenting the
resource to visitors? Can it be made accessible and be presented to special populations?<BR>
<BR>
<I>Local Population</I> - Will either the development or preservation of cultural resources be
supportive or in conflict with local values, land use patterns, and restrictions?<BR>
<BR>
<I>Cost</I> - Does the significance of the resource warrant the cost of its preservation in
terms of money, work effort, materials, and impact on the environment?<BR>
<BR>
<I>Availability of Funds</I> - No development. should be allowed where there are 
significant cultural resources unless the project includes sufficient funding for preservation
and protection during construction of the development and subsequent use of the site.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>A range of acceptable and feasible preservation alternatives will be completed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Selection of an Alternative</B><BR>
To choose a preservation alternative that meets all applicable laws and standards and that is acceptable to all interested parties.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Each alternative will normally consist of a combination of one or more of the following treatments:<BR>
<BR>
<I>Documentation</I> - This option is a prerequisite for all other treatment.  It is also the most sustainable treatment in that, except for very fragile sites, this procedure has no impact on the resource.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Stabilization</I> - The primary intent of stabilization is to prevent further deterioration or to improve safety.  Often, this may include backfilling of excavated archaeological resources.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Preservation</I> - This treatment seeks to keep the resource in its present condition or appearance.  It may require some initial and periodic repair, but most work involves maintenance.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Restoration</I> - This method attempts to return a resource to a previous appearance or condition.  It is usually appropriate only if the importance of the resource lies in the story it can tell.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Reconstruction</I> - This option attempts to replace a resource or part of a resource that no longer exists with a replica.  Minor reconstruction may be incorporated as part of preservation or restoration treatment.  Reconstruction of an entire structure is seldom justified.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Rehabilitation</I> - This option seeks to reuse or find an alternative use for a cultural resource.  It is appropriate where the resource is part of a larger one, such as a historic district, and where the exterior appearance is of primary importance.  This may also be considered a sustainable option in that it reuses existing materials and extends the functional life of the structure.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Revitalization</I> - This option involved the reestablishment of the cultural landscape<BR>
<BR>
<I>Relocation</I> - If the original location of the resource is not of primary importance, or if no other alternative is feasible, relocation may be acceptable.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Demolition</I> - If a resource is inherently unsafe, or the benefits of the proposed development outweigh cultural importance of the resource, or no other treatment is feasible, demolition may be the treatment of last recourse.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>The resulting treatment plan should protect fragile cultural resources in an environmentally sustainable manner.  With active community involvement, this plan should also reflect the best interests of the local population.<BR>
<BR>
If no development has been decided for a site that contains cultural resources, a strategy must be devised to help protect them.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Construction Documents</B><BR>
To provide instructions for treating nonrenewable cultural resources, and to ensure that the treatment is  carried out in a sustainable, ecologically sensitive manner.<BR>
<BR>
NOTE: if the development project does not directly involve the cultural resources except as objects of interpretation and visitation, the plans and specifications for new construction may need only provide for the protection of cultural resources at the site.  Where the development directly involves the resources (reuse or adaptive use or presentation of cultural resources to visitors) and for the various treatments that may be accorded them, several items should be considered in preparation of the construction documents.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>In general, the materials and workmanship used to treat culture resources should be as         
much like the originals as possible. This may not be possible, and it may not always be desirable.  In many instances chemical treatment or the use of nonhistoric materials could be necessary, or the use of equipment that has the potential to damage both  the natural and cultural resources could be contemplated. Considerations for the protection of both the cultural and natural environments include:<BR>
<BR>                                                   
<I>Replacement Materials</I> - Is the material ecologically sensitive and sustainable? If not, and the specific material is critical to the integrity of the resource, future availability should be ensured (e.g., plant trees to be used for future replacement of rare woods)<BR>
<BR>
If replacement by precisely the same material is not necessary, a different species, source, or manufacturing process should be identified for a similar and compatible product.  New, ecologically sensitive products should be considered. Suitable recycled materials should be used.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Treatment</I> - Reversibility in the design of the treatment or facility should be considered.  Can it ever be removed? If so, how? What would be the effect if it were?<BR>
<BR>
<I>Workmanship</I> - Most cultural resources in ecologically sensitive areas were probably built without mechanical equipment, so such equipment should not be necessary for repairs.  The original method of construction is often the most compatible aesthetically and physically.  These construction techniques may still be used by the local people.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Incentives</I> - Construction documents should include provisions to encourage environmental sensitivity.  There could be credits for minimal disturbance during construction and fines for adverse effects. Shared savings or bonuses might be considered for contractors who recommend other suitable and ecologically sensitive materials, who locate sources of salvaged or reusable materials, or who identify potential users or recycling opportunities for salvageable material from the project.<BR>
<BR>
Any development should respond to and reflect the cultural heritage of the local environment. If there are cultural resources onsite or nearby, it may be desirable to include elements of the cultural past in the new design. These factors should reflect a contemporary interpretation of the cultural themes and charter defining elements
without mimicry. Consider abstract representations and be compatible in color, texture, scale, and mass.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Documents containing instructions for undertaking development in areas containing cultural resources, or for treating the resources themselves will result.  These documents will incorporate special techniques for the protection of both natural and cultural resources and require the use of ecologically sensitive materials and construction techniques.</TD</TR>


<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Construction</B><BR>
To avoid damage to known and unknown resources<BR>
<BR>
NOTE: If alternatives for development include a construction option, there will usually be ground disturbance.  This could affect the natural environment and any possible cultural resources.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP> All of the research and planning that precedes the construction phase should ensure the preservation of any cultural resources.  However, the following issues can still occur:<BR>
<BR.
<I>Discovery of Unknown Cultural Resources</I> - Such resources tend to be archaeological and are uncovered during construction.  There are usually three options.<BR>
<BR>
The <I>first</I> option is to avoid the resources.<BR>
The <I>second</I> option is mitigation - incorporating the resource into the development or moving it.  Both options frequently lead to redesign of the project.<BR>
The <I>third</I> option is demolition after the data have been recorded and archived.<BR>
<BR>
The option chosen will depend on the relative importance of the cultural resources in comparison to the development.  Additional funds and time will be required, and this is a contingency that must be accommodated.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Resource Protection</I> - Both natural and cultural resources must be protected from damage during construction.  This may involve fences or barricades, covers, or other special measures.  It may require the use of less efficient construction methods, such as hand tools or light equipment.  Even minor impacts can be permanent.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Worker Health/Safety</I> - This is paramount.  Construction materials, methods, and processes that involve toxins and debilitating noise levels must be avoided.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Plans for artifact salvage and curation and documentation of construction, monitoring, and a preservation process for future reference will result.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Work Force</B><BR>
To involve the local population in the appreciation and preservation of their resources</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Any development in a sensitive area is apt to have a significant effect on the local community and will probably effect the economy and land use patterns.  Use of local workers will help ensure benefits to the local economy and create goodwill.<BR>
<BR>
In many areas, there is a tradition of taking existing cultural remains for reuse in new structures.  While reuse of building materials in situ may be commendable from a sustainability standpoint, such involvement will teach the local population that existing structures considered to be of cultural importance are themselves resources to be conserved.  Further, the craft methods and tools used in the original construction of the cultural resources may still be in use by the local people.  If this is true, not only will the people be the most skilled at making necessary repairs, but also it will provide an opportunity to perpetuate the use of artisan building practices and traditional tools as a viable part of the culture.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP> The use of local workers in the preservation of cultural resources enhances the local population's appreciation of the value of their resources, contributes to the conservation of local folkways, and trains future artists in traditional craft methods.  It will also contribute to a pride of heritage and visitor education.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Preventive Maintenance Plan</B><BR>
To prevent loss of or damage to nonrenewable cultural resources and reduce repairs by establishing a scheduled system of inspections and service.<BR>
<BR>
NOTE: Many cultural resources are examples of sustainable design. They have survived over time. A good preventive maintenance plan will ensure that cultural resources are protected for generations to come.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>A preventive maintenance program requires a maintenance staff with the proper skills,
knowledge, equipment, and materials.<BR>
<BR>
Before the decision is made to develop an area, consideration Should be given as to whether the development can generate sufficient funding to provide for a cultural resource maintenance budget.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Resources will be preserved for future generations with the least loss of integrity; materials and techniques that are both appropriate and ecologically sustainable will be used; and a system of scheduled maintenance will ensure proper and timely treatment and documentation of all work done.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Cyclic Maintenance Plan</B><BR>
To plan for foreseeable limited replacement of resources due to service life; and to ensure resource longevity through prudent sustainable maintenance procedures.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>A cyclic maintenance plan should include:<BR>
<BR>
<I>Life-Cycle Costs of Materials</I> -  Quality products last forger, but are they environmentally appropriate and sensitive when analyzed on a cradle-to-grave basis?<BR>
<BR>
<I>Funding</I> - Maintenance funding should be safeguarded. It should be separate from other funds.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Staff</I> - A dependable skilled work force is critical.<BR>  
<BR>
<I>Monitoring</I> - Wear and tear should be checked for evidence that carrying capacity is being exceeded.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Cultural resources will be repaired in a timely manner; a multiyear plan of cyclic maintenance tasks will be prepared; a consistent local labor pool will be ensured; energy conservation will be achieved by extending the useful life of products; and records will be kept of monitored data and energy consumption feedback.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Operating Plan</B><BR>
To provide daily ecologically sensitive housekeeping, interpretation, and use of cultural resources, and the means for monitoring and obtaining feedback for cyclic maintenance plan.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Ecologically sensitive use of cultural resources includes the following:<BR>
<BR>
<I>Interpretation</I> - Observation methods will be interpreted through multimedia and/or tours.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Computerization</I> - Data analysis and sharing work plans will be managed by computer.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Video</I> - Videos will be used for training and job recruitment among locals and others.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Self-regulation</I> - A voucher system will be used for limiting stays at resource-sensitive areas to avoid negative impacts.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Sustainable property will be in a maintainable condition that is useful to occupants.  Success will be measured and certificates issues for resource-sensitive operations by an independent evaluator (Ecotourism Society, International Travel Associations, etc.).</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Disaster Planning</B><BR>
To preplan specific actions for minimizing loss of and damage to nonrenewable cultural resources in the event of a disaster.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Most disasters can be attributed to wind, natural forces. (e.g. hurricane, earthquake, flood), damage from domestic water and sewer systems, fires, war, vandalism, and theft.  Some elements that should be considered are:<BR>                                         
<BR>
<I>Design</I> - Facilities should be designed to either withstand natural forces (sufficient mass and detail) or  to yield to them (light and of renewable materials).<BR>
<BR>
<I>Fire and Security Systems: Plans and Preparation</I> - There should be a plan for emergency removal and storage of artifacts.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Reinforcement</I> - Structural modifications should be made so resources could withstand winds, earthquakes, and floods.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Resources will be sensitively modified to withstand certain natural forces;
systems will be in place to protect structures from fire, domestic water damage, and theft; plans will be in place for protecting or temporarily removing artifacts; safe display and storage of artifacts will be ensured; and necessary equipment, supplies, and human resources (rescuers or repair crews) will be available through an incident command system.</TD></TR>
