    <h1>Technical Notes</h1>
    <p class="introtext">The data in this report come from many sources, including surveys conducted by the National Science Foundation (NSF), other federal agencies, and nonfederal organizations. Many methods of data collection are represented. Therefore, users should take great care when comparing data from different sources. These data often will not be strictly comparable because of differences in definitions, survey procedures, and phrasing of questions, among other things.</p>

    </ul>
    <a name="repcat" id="repcat"></a>
    <h2>Reporting Categories</h2>
    <p>This report draws on data collected from many sources, many of which use differing terms to describe the various statistics presented here. Efforts have been made to maintain consistency throughout these tables, but in some tables, it has been necessary to use distinct terminology that does not match that used in other tables.</p>
    <h3>Racial/Ethnic Information</h3>
    <p>The collection and reporting of race/ethnicity data pose several additional problems. First, both the naming of population subgroups and their definitions have changed over time. Second, many of the groups of particular interest are quite small, so it is difficult to measure them accurately without surveys of the entire population of interest. In some instances, sample surveys may not have had sufficient sample size to permit the calculation of reliable racial/ethnic population estimates for all groups; consequently, data are not shown for some groups. The U.S. Bureau of the Census's Current Population Survey, for example, cannot provide data on American Indians. Data on this population are available only from the decennial census. Third, data on race/ethnicity are often based on self-identification. These data are less reliable for certain racial/ethnic groups than for others. Data collected at two points in time indicate that self-identification of American Indians is much less reliable than self-identification of other racial/ethnic groups (<a href="#uslabor95">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 1995</a>). Fourth, it is easy to overlook or minimize heterogeneity within subgroups when only a single statistic is reported for a total racial/ ethnic group.</p>
    <p>In October 1997, the U.S. Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) announced new government-wide standards for the collection of  data on race and ethnicity (published as U.S. OMB 1999) effective January 1,  2003. OMB specified the following categories and definitions of racial/ethnic  groups: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Black or African American: A person having  origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa </li>
      <li>American Indian or Alaska Native: A person  having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including  Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment </li>
      <li>Asian: A person having origins in any of the  original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent;  for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the  Philippine Islands, Samoa, Thailand, and Vietnam </li>
      <li>Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander: A  person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii,  Guam, or other Pacific islands </li>
      <li>White: A person having origins in any of the  original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North   Africa </li>
      <li>Hispanic or Latino: A person of Cuban,  Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or  origin, regardless of race </li>
      <li>More than one race reported: A person reporting  two or more of the racial/ethnic categories listed above </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Previously, racial/ethnic groups were identified as white; black; Hispanic; Asian or Pacific Islander; and American Indian or Alaskan Native. Because of these changes, data on Asian doctorate recipients include Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders through 2000 but exclude them in 2001-06 per revised OMB guidelines. The 2006 data on employment includes Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander and multiple race in the total but does not show detail for those groups separately. Because data on undergraduate enrollment and bachelor’s and master’s degree data were still collected under the old standards through 2006, the racial/ethnic groups described in those tables are designated by the old categories. Similarly, because few schools collected racial/ethnic data according to the new standards and few reported graduate enrollment according to the new standards, the racial/ethnic groups described in the graduate enrollment tables are designated by the old categories.</p>
    <h3>Information About People with Disabilities</h3>
    <p>Data on people with disabilities who study or  work in science and engineering (S&amp;E) are seriously limited for several  reasons. First, the operational definitions of disability vary, can include a  wide range of physical and mental conditions, and may not be comparable. The <a href="http://www.ada.gov/pubs/ada.htm">Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990</a> (ADA)  encouraged progress toward standard definitions. Under ADA, an individual is considered to have a  disability if he or she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially  limits one or more of his or her major life activities, has a record of such  impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment. ADA also contains definitions of specific  disabilities.</p>
    <p>Second, data on disabilities frequently are  not included in comprehensive institutional records (e.g., in registrars'  records in institutions of higher education). If included at all, such  information may be kept only in confidential files at an office responsible for  providing special services to students. Institutions of higher education are  unlikely to have information regarding students with disabilities who have not  requested special services related to their disabilities from the institutions.  In elementary/secondary school programs receiving funds to provide special  education, however, statistics on all students identified as having special  needs are centrally available.</p>
    <p>Third, information about people with disabilities  that is gathered from surveys is often obtained from self-reported responses.  Typically, respondents are asked whether they have a disability and to specify  what kind of disability it is. Resulting data therefore reflect individual  perceptions rather than objective measures.</p>
    <p>The attempt to provide estimates of the  proportion of the undergraduate student population with disabilities is an  example of how these factors coalesce. Self-reported data on the undergraduate  student population, collected through a survey to ascertain patterns of student  financial aid, suggest that about 10% of this population have some disability.  Estimates from population surveys of higher education institutions, in  contrast, place the estimate much lower, between 1% and 5%. Whether this  discrepancy is the result of self-perception, incomplete reporting, nonevident  disabilities, or differing definitions is difficult to ascertain.</p>
    <p>In the final analysis, although considerable  information is available about individuals with disabilities in the education  system and in the S&amp;E workforce, it is often impossible to compare  statistics from different sources.</p>
    <p>Several sources of data on people with  disabilities are cited here. They include the National Postsecondary Student  Aid Study (NPSAS) conducted by the Department of Education's National Center  for Education Statistics (NCES), NSF's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), and NSF’s  Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT). These sources are  described in more detail later in this appendix; the following is a brief  description of how each treats the issue of disability.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>NPSAS (2004) asked students whether they had any longlasting  condition (6 months or more)  &quot;such as blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing impairment&quot; or &quot;that substantially limits one or more basic physical activities, such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying&quot; or &quot;any other physical, mental, emotional, or learning condition that has lasted 6 months or more.&quot;</li>
      <li>SED asks if the respondent has a disability then asks the respondent to mark which categories describe the disability(ies). Response categories include: blind/visually impaired; deaf/hard of hearing; physical/orthopedic disability; learning/cognitive disability; vocal/speech disability; other disability. </li>
      <li>The SESTAT surveys ask the degree of difficulty—none, slight, moderate, severe, or unable to do—an individual has in seeing (with glasses), hearing (with hearing aid), walking without assistance, or lifting. Those respondents who answered &quot;moderate,&quot; &quot;severe,&quot; or &quot;unable to do&quot; for any activity are classified as disabled. </li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Primary Data Sources</h2>
      <p>Data from several sources are presented here.  This section provides summary descriptions of major sources and information  about the location of more detailed survey descriptions.</p>
      <h3>Primary NSF Sources</h3>
      <p>The following sources from NSF's <a href="/statistics/">Division of Science Resources Statistics</a> (SRS) were used for data tables in this publication. Published data tables from  these surveys can be accessed on the SRS Website at <a href="/statistics/">http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/</a>. In  addition, researchers may access data directly from the <a href="/statistics/sestat/">Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System</a> (SESTAT) or the <a href="http://webcaspar.nsf.gov/">WebCASPAR database system</a>,  which also can be accessed from the SRS Website.</p>
    <h4>Survey of Earned Doctorates</h4>
      <p>SED has been conducted annually since 1957 for NSF, the U.S. Department of Education, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Institutes of Health, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This survey is of all recipients of research doctoral degrees from U.S. institutions. SED data are restricted to research doctorates such as the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) or doctor of science (D.Sc.); it excludes the recipients of first professional degrees such as the juris doctor (J.D.) or doctor of medicine (M.D.).</p>
      <p>Data for SED are collected directly from  individual doctorate recipients contacted through graduate deans at all U.S.  universities awarding research doctorates. The recipients are asked to provide  information about the fields and specialties of their degrees as well as their  personal educational histories, selected demographic data, and information  about their postgraduate work and study plans. Over time, more than 90% of the  annual cohort of doctorate recipients have responded to the questionnaire.</p>
      <p>Partial data from public sources, such as  field of study, are added to the file for nonrespondents. No imputations are  made, however, for nonresponse for data not available elsewhere, such as  race/ethnicity information. The data for a given year include all doctorates  awarded in the 12-month period ending on June 30 of that year. Information  about SED can be found at <a href="/statistics/srvydoctorates/">http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctorates/</a>.</p>
      <h4>Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering</h4>
      <p>The data collected in the Survey of Graduate  Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering (GSS) represent national  estimates of graduate enrollment and postdoctoral employment at the beginning  of the academic year in all academic institutions in the United States that offer  doctoral or master's degree programs in any S&amp;E or health field. Included  are data for all branch campuses; affiliated research centers; and separately  organized components such as medical or dental schools, schools of nursing, and  schools of public health. The survey population consists of approximately 600  graduate institutions. Data are collected at the academic department level.</p>
      <p>Approximately 97%&#8211;98% of institutions and  departments respond to the survey. Missing data for partially nonrespondent  departments are imputed using the departments' previous year's data, where  available, or data from peer institutions in cases where data had not been  reported the previous year. Data for completely nonrespondent departments are  imputed using data from the previous year, where available.</p>
      <p>Available information includes counts of  full-time graduate students by source and mechanism of support, including data  on women and first-year students enrolled full time, part-time graduate  students by sex, and citizenship and racial/ethnic background of all graduate  students. In addition, data on postdoctorates are available by source of  support, sex, and citizenship, including separate data on those holding first  professional doctorates in the health fields; summary information about other  doctoral nonfaculty research personnel is also included.</p>
      <p>NSF has collected data on graduate S&amp;E  enrollment and postdoctoral appointees since 1966. From fall 1966 through fall  1971, data from a limited number of doctorate-granting institutions were  collected through the NSF Graduate Traineeship Program, which requested data  only on those S&amp;E fields supported by NSF. During the period 1972&#8211;75, this  data collection effort was gradually expanded to include additional S&amp;E  fields as well as all institutions known to have programs leading to the  master's or doctoral degree. Because of this expansion, data for 1974 and  earlier years are not strictly comparable with 1975 and later data.</p>
      <p>In 1999, the survey presented respondents with  new race/ethnicity categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The &quot;Asian/Pacific Islander&quot; category used in previous years' surveys became two categories: &quot;Asian&quot; and &quot;Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander.&quot;</li>
        <li>The categories &quot;more than one race Hispanic/Latino&quot; and &quot;more than one race non-Hispanic/Latino&quot; were added.</li>
        <li>The &quot;other&quot; category included in previous years' surveys was removed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These changes are not reflected in the tables  in this report. Currently, fewer than 10% of the departments report data in any  of the new categories. For the tables in this report, as in other publications  using these data, the data reported in the new categories are combined into  previous survey categories. The data are combined for the tables as follows:  the &quot;Asian&quot; category and the &quot;Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander&quot;  category form the &quot;Asian/Pacific Islander&quot; category; the &quot;one  race only Hispanic/Latino&quot; category and the &quot;more than one race  Hispanic/Latino&quot; category form the &quot;Hispanic&quot; category; and the  &quot;more than one race non-Hispanic&quot; category and the  &quot;unknown&quot; category form the &quot;other or unknown&quot; category.<br />

      <h3>SESTAT Data System</h3>
      <p>The SESTAT data system integrates data from  three SRS surveys—the Survey of Doctorate Recipients, the National Survey of  College Graduates, and the National Survey of Recent College Graduates. The  integration of the SESTAT surveys requires complementary sample populations and  reference periods, matching survey questions, procedures, and field  definitions, as well as weighting adjustments for any overlapping populations.</p>
      <p>The surveys provide data on educational  background, occupation, employment, and demographic characteristics. These  surveys are of individuals and currently have a combined sample size of about 105,100,  representing a population of about 22.6 million scientists and engineers,  including people trained in S&amp;E or S&amp;E-related fields or working in  S&amp;E or S&amp;E-related occupations. Each of the three surveys that makes up  the SESTAT data system collects new data every 2 years. The data reported in  this publication were collected in 2006.</p>
      <p>SESTAT defines scientists and engineers as  residents of the United States with a baccalaureate degree or higher who, as of  the study's reference period (April 1, 2006), were not institutionalized, were  age 75 or less, and were either educated as or working as a scientist or  engineer. A baccalaureate or higher degree is a bachelor's, master's,  doctorate, or professional degree. To meet the scientist or engineer definition,  the U.S.  resident had to (1) have at least one baccalaureate or higher degree in an  S&amp;E or S&amp;E-related field or (2) as of October 1, 2003, have a  baccalaureate or higher degree in a non-S&amp;E field but worked in an S&amp;E  or S&amp;E-related occupation. Some elements of SESTAT’s desired target  population were not included within the target populations of any of the three  SESTAT component surveys. S&amp;E or S&amp;E-related personnel missing from the  survey frames in 2006 are predominately U.S. residents as of the survey  reference date:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whose bachelor’s or higher degrees in S&amp;E  or S&amp;E-related fields were received from a foreign institution and who  resided outside the United    States on April 1, 2000 </li>
        <li>Who were awarded bachelor’s or higher S&amp;E  or S&amp;E-related degrees after June 2005 by a U.S. institution</li>
        <li>Who were employed in an S&amp;E occupation,  but had no S&amp;E or S&amp;E-related bachelor’s or higher degree and were not  employed in an S&amp;E occupation on October 1, 2003 </li>
      </ul>
      <p>SESTAT classifies the following broad  categories as S&amp;E occupations: computer and mathematical scientists, life  and related scientists, physical and related scientists, social and related  scientists, and engineers. Postsecondary teachers are included within each of  these groups. The following are considered S&amp;E-related occupations: health  and related occupations;, S&amp;E managers; S&amp;E precollege teachers; S&amp;E  technicians and technologists, including computer programmers; and other  S&amp;E-related occupations, such as architects and actuaries. Non-S&amp;E  occupations include non-S&amp;E managers; non-S&amp;E teachers; non-S&amp;E  technicians/technologists; social services and related occupations; sales and  marketing occupations; art, humanities, and related occupations; and other  non-S&amp;E occupations—for example, clerical and administrative support  personnel, farmers, foresters, fishermen, lawyers, judges, librarians,  archivists, curators, food service personnel, construction tradespeople,  mechanics and repairers, and those involved in precision/production occupations,  operators (for example, machine set-up, machine operators and tenders,  fabricators, assemblers) and related occupations, transportation/material  moving occupations and protective and other service occupations. Information on  SESTAT can be found on the Web at <a href="/statistics/sestat/">http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/sestat/</a>.</p>
      <h3>Primary Non-NSF Sources</h3>
      <p>The following non-NSF sources were used for data tables in this report.</p>
      <h4>The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Survey: Fall Enrollment, Completions, and Institutional Characteristics</h4>
      <p>National Center for Education  Statistics<br />
        U.S. Department of Education<br />

        <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds">http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds</a></p>
      <p>The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data  System (IPEDS) Survey began in 1986 as a supplement to and replacement for the  Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS), which began in 1966. HEGIS  annually surveyed institutions listed in the current NCES Education Directory  of Colleges and Universities; IPEDS surveys all postsecondary institutions,  including universities and colleges and the institutions that offer technical  and vocational education. IPEDS consists of several integrated component  surveys that obtain information about types of institutions where postsecondary  education is available, student participants, fall enrollments, programs  offered and completed, graduation rates, and the human and financial resources  involved in the delivery of postsecondary education. Descriptions of these  surveys follow.</p>
      <p>The IPEDS Institutional Characteristics Survey  provides the basis for the list of institutions reported in the Education  Directory of Colleges and Universities. The list includes institutions that  meet specific accreditation criteria and offer at least a 1-year program of  college-level studies leading to a degree. Each fall, institutions listed in  the previous year's directory are asked to update information about their  school's characteristics.</p>
      <p>The IPEDS Completions Survey replaces and  extends the HEGIS Degrees and Other Formal Awards Conferred Survey. It is  administered to all institutions offering degrees at the bachelor's degree  level and above, 2-year institutions, and less-than-2-year institutions.</p>
      <p>The IPEDS Fall Enrollment Survey replaces and  extends the previous HEGIS surveys of enrollment in institutions of higher  education.</p>

        <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/npsas">http://nces.ed.gov/npsas</a> </p>
      <p>NPSAS was established by NCES to collect  information about financial aid allocated to students enrolled in U.S.  postsecondary institutions. NPSAS was first administered in the fall of the  1986-87 academic year. NCES conducted subsequent cycles of NPSAS during the  1989&#8211;90, 1992&#8211;93, 1995&#8211;96, 1999&#8211;2000 , and 2003&#8211;04 academic years.</p>
      <p>The 2003&#8211;04 survey gathered information from  about 101,000 undergraduate and graduate students selected from registrars'  lists of enrollees at more than 1,300 postsecondary institutions. The sample  included students who did and did not receive financial aid, as well as  students' parents. Student information, such as field of study, educational  level, and attendance status (part time or full time), was obtained from  registrars' records. Types and amounts of financial aid and family financial  characteristics were abstracted from school financial aid records. Data  pertaining to family circumstances, background demographic data, educational  and work experiences, and expectations were collected from students using a  computer-assisted telephone interview. The weighted response rate was 91%.</p>

      <p> The Engineering Workforce Commission (EWC)  annually conducts surveys of engineering enrollments and degrees conferred in  almost 600 institutions, including all of those with curricula approved by the  Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). EWC counts the  number of students studying for engineering degrees at all ABET-accredited  engineering schools throughout the United States and also some schools  that are not ABET-accredited for a variety of reasons unique to each school.  Some schools are in the process of obtaining ABET accreditation; others have  simply asked to be included in the survey. The enrollments and degrees surveys  obtain responses from about 90% of the schools. Each year, EWC obtains data  from all schools included in the previous year's survey to ensure accurate  time-series comparisons.</p>

    <h2>Sampling and Nonsampling Errors</h2>
    <p>The data from all of the sources used for this  report are subject to error. Survey accuracy is determined by the joint effects  of sampling and nonsampling errors. Sampling errors arise because estimates based on a sample differ from figures  that would have been obtained if a complete population had been surveyed. The  sample used for any particular survey is only one of a large number of possible  samples of the same size and design that could have been selected. Even if all  other aspects of the survey remained fixed, such as the questionnaire and  instructions, the estimates from each sample would differ from other samples.  This difference, termed <em>sampling error</em>,  occurs by chance, and its variability is measured by the standard error  associated with a particular estimate.</p>
    <p>The standard error of a sample survey estimate  measures the precision with which an estimate from one sample approximates the  true population value, and it can be used to construct a confidence interval  for a survey parameter to assess the accuracy of the estimate. See <a href="/statistics/sestat/calcerror.cfm">http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/sestat/calcerror.cfm</a> for information about calculation of standard errors for data from SESTAT, <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/home.htm">http://www.bls.gov/cps/home.htm</a> for  Current Population Survey design and methodology, and <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2006180">http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2006180</a> for information on standard errors for NPSAS data.</p>
    <p>Nonsampling errors can arise from design,  reporting, and processing errors as well as from errors due to faulty responses  or nonresponses. Nonsampling errors include respondent-based events, such as  some respondents interpreting questions differently from other respondents;  respondents making estimates rather than giving actual data; and respondents  being unable or unwilling to provide complete, correct information. Errors can  also arise during the processing of responses, such as during recording and  keying.  Nonsampling errors are difficult  to measure and estimates of nonsampling errors are not available for data in  this report.</p>
