Our sports-loving nation loves a winner, and it's fair to say that
most of the 5 million boys and girls who compete in high school
sports love to win.  Some of them will go to great lengths to do
so.  That may mean using performance-enhancing drugs such as
anabolic steroids and human growth hormone.
<p>
Anabolic steroids--compounds similar to the male hormone
testosterone--are too often used by athletes, both boys and girls,
to build muscle.  They are also used by young men who just want to
look better.  They are prescription drugs, but most of those who
use them obtain them illegally, often from the black market.
Steroids have a lot of unwanted side effects--that's why they are
supposed to be sold only by prescription.  They may well build
muscle, but it's a losing proposition, because their
use--particularly in the large doses that athletes take--can stunt
growth, lead to cancer, ruin the liver, and bring on other
complications, including enlarged breasts in boys.  For girls, the
side effects include developing masculine traits that may be
irreversible.
<p>
Black-market steroids often are produced in another country or by
clandestine domestic manufacturers under questionable conditions
and may be contaminated.  The quacks have also moved in with phony
steroids and phony pills that they say--falsely--will counter some of
the side effects of steroids.
<p>
Earlier this year, FDA warned that a counterfeit version of the
hormone human chorionic gonadotropin, or HCG, was being sold to
weight lifters and other athletes.  The bogus hormones were
contaminated with a substance that causes infections and fever.
<p>
A black market has also sprung up for human growth hormone.  This
prescription drug is legitimately given to children who suffer from
pituitary dwarfism or growth hormone deficiency, but it, too, has
dangerous side effects.  Nevertheless, athletes seeking to benefit
from added growth are buying the hormone on the black market.
Quacks are also marketing "growth tablets" that, in fact, contain
no hormones or any other ingredients that can promote growth.
