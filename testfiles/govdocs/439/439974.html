TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS<BR>
FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT<BR>
</P>

<P>BRIEF FOR THE FEDERAL RESPONDENTS<BR>
IN OPPOSITION<BR>
</P>

<P>OPINIONS BELOW</P>

<P>The opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1-17) is reported at 265
F.3d 1135. The decision of the Surface Transportation Board (Pet. App. 18-26)
is unreported. The decision of the arbitrator (Pet. App. 27-34) is also
unreported.</P>

<P>JURISDICTION</P>

<P>The court of appeals entered its judgment on September 19, 2001. The
petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on December 18, 2001. This Court's
jurisdiction is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).</P>

<P>STATEMENT</P>

<P>1. Railroads wishing to consolidate or merge their properties must first
obtain regulatory approval from the Surface Transportation Board (Board).
See 49 U.S.C. 11323-11326 (Supp. V 1999). The Board may approve a proposed
consolidation if it finds that the transaction is in the public interest,
49 U.S.C. 11324(c) (Supp. V 1999), taking into account such public benefits
as cost reductions, service improvements, and efficiency gains. See, e.g.,
Union Pacific/Southern Pacific Merger, 1 S.T.B. 233, 363-364 (1996), aff'd
sub nom. Western Coal Traffic League v. Surface Transp. Bd., 169 F.3d 775
(D.C. Cir. 1999). Once a consolidation is approved by the Board, the railroad
may implement the merger and, in so doing, &quot;is exempt from the antitrust
laws and from all other law,&quot; 49 U.S.C. 11321(a) (Supp. V 1999),1 which
can include legal obligations under a collective bargaining agreement, see
Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. v. American Train Dispatchers' Ass'n, 499 U.S.
117, 127-130 (1991).</P>

<P>When large railroads merge, the Board is required to impose certain conditions
for the protection of affected railroad employees. 49 U.S.C. 11326 (Supp.
V 1999).2 That Section requires a &quot;fair arrangement&quot; for employees
affected by the merger, 49 U.S.C. 11326(a) (Supp. V 1999), and incorporates
the protections of the Rail Passenger Service Act, 45 U.S.C. 565 (1988),
for &quot;the preservation of rights, privileges, and benefits&quot; under
existing collective bargaining agreements. The Board's predecessor, the
Interstate Commerce Commission, further identified a series of specific
conditions for the protection of employees in New York Dock Railway- Control-Brooklyn
Eastern District Terminal, 360 I.C.C. 60, 84-90, aff'd, 609 F.2d 83 (2d
Cir. 1979). See Pet. App. 44-56. As relevant here, the New York Dock conditions
require that the</P>

<P>rates of pay, rules, working conditions and all collective bargaining
and other rights, privileges and benefits (including continuation of pension
rights and benefits) of the railroad's employees under applicable laws and/or
existing collective bargaining agreements or otherwise shall be preserved
unless changed by future collective bargaining agreements or applicable
statutes.</P>

<P>360 I.C.C. at 84.</P>

<P>Under 49 U.S.C. 11321(a) (Supp. V 1999), an agreement or arbitration
order implementing a merger may displace provisions of collective bargaining
agreements to the extent &quot;necessary.&quot; See also Norfolk, 499 U.S.
at 127-128. Abrogation of the collective bargaining agreement's terms is
&quot;necessary&quot; if (1) some transportation benefit, such as enhanced
efficiency or greater safety, will result from the underlying transaction,
and (2) there is a nexus between the changes sought and effectuation of
the Board-approved transaction. United Transp. Union v. Surface Transp.
Bd., 108 F.3d 1425, 1430-1431 (D.C. Cir. 1997).</P>

<P>Before any operational changes affecting employees can be made, carriers
must negotiate with their unions. If those negotiations fail, the parties
must submit to binding arbitration. New York Dock, 360 I.C.C. at 85. The
arbitral decision can be appealed to the Board under the limited standard
of review established in Chicago &amp; North Western Transportation Co.-Abandonment-Near
Dubuque &amp; Oelwein, IA, 3 I.C.C.2d 729, 735-736 (1987), aff'd sub nom.
IBEW v. ICC, 862 F.2d 330 (D.C. Cir. 1988); see also 49 C.F.R. 1115.8. Under
that standard, the Board's review of arbitrators' decisions is generally
limited to &quot;recurring or otherwise significant issues of general importance
regarding the interpretation of [its] labor protective conditions.&quot;
3 I.C.C.2d at 736. The Board does not overturn an arbitrator's resolution
of factual disputes in the absence of &quot;egregious error.&quot; Id. at
735-736.</P>

<P>2. Petitioners are former employees of the now-defunct Rock Island and
Pacific Railroad Company on its Tucumcari line out of Pratt, Kansas. In
1980, the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company (St. Louis Railway) acquired
the Tucumcari Line from the bankrupt Rock Island. Petitioners were hired
by the St. Louis Railway and were given preference on Tucumcari line work
over other St. Louis Railway employees, even though petitioners' system-wide
&quot;seniority date&quot;-the date normally used to determine priority
in bidding for work-was their date of hire by the St. Louis Railway. Pet.
App. 4.</P>

<P>In 1996, the Board approved the merger of Union Pacific Railroad Company
and the St. Louis Railway's parent company, the Southern Pacific Rail Corporation.
Through the merger, Union Pacific acquired all of the rail carriers controlled
by Southern Pacific, including the St. Louis Railway. Pet. App. 4. The Board
approved the merger as in the public interest because, among other things,
it would lead to greater efficiencies that would result in improved and
less costly rail service. See Union Pacific/Southern Pacific Merger, 1 S.T.B.
at 363-364. Among the promised efficiencies were the streamlining and consolidation
of operations through the use of a &quot;hub and spoke&quot; system, with
one of the hubs located at Salina, Kansas, and encompassing the Tucumcari
Line. Pet. App. 19.</P>

<P>After notice was formally given and negotiations were held, Union Pacific
and the United Transportation Union (Union)-representing all conductors,
foremen, brakemen, and yardmen affected by the implementation of the Salina
Hub, including petitioners-reached a tentative implementing agreement for
the Salina Hub. Pet. App. 27-28. Under the tentative agreement, employees
from several districts, who had been governed by different collective bargaining
agreements, would be put under a single agreement, with their seniority
dovetailed based upon the employee's seniority date. Preference in bidding
for work would be based on system-wide seniority, with one exception: no
employee would lose existing &quot;prior rights&quot; seniority as to the
rail lines on which he had originally worked vis-a-vis other employees who
also worked on those lines before the merger. Thus, petitioners would retain
their preference over former St. Louis Railway employees in bidding for
work on the Tucumcari Line, but they would have to compete with other Union
Pacific employees based on their relative system-wide seniority. Id. at
5, 29.</P>

<P>3. Dissatisfied with their limited preference and with the decision to
site the &quot;home terminal&quot; at Herington, Kansas, rather than Pratt,
Kansas, petitioners' local union official objected to the tentative agreement.
The dispute was submitted to binding arbitration.</P>

<P>The arbitrator found the tentative agreement to be a fair and equitable
method of blending the rights of all affected employees. Pet. App. 27-34.
The arbitrator concluded that a public transportation benefit would result
from the hub-and-spoke operation at Salina and that both the seniority provisions
and the establishment of Herington as the home terminal were related to
the successful implementation of that hub-and-spoke operation. Id. at 31-32,
34. The arbitrator found no merit to petitioners' arguments that the agreement
was unfair to them or that the changes it put into place were not necessary.
Id. at 31-34.</P>

<P>The Board affirmed. Pet. App. 18-26. Characterizing petitioners' appeal
as presenting a fact-bound challenge to the public transportation benefits
arising from the seniority and hub-location changes (id. at 24), the Board
sustained the arbitrator's decision because petitioners &quot;failed to
show that the arbitrator committed egregious error in making these findings,&quot;
ibid.3</P>

<P>4. The court of appeals affirmed. Pet. App. 1-17. Tracking the decision
of the D.C. Circuit in United Transportation Union v. Surface Transportation
Board, 108 F.3d 1425 (1997), the court of appeals recognized that seniority
rights must be modified in some manner in nearly all railroad mergers. The
court accordingly ruled that the Board's determination that seniority rights
can be modified when necessary to carry out an approved consolidation is
reasonable and effectuates congressional intent. Pet. App. 9-10. The court
further agreed with the Board and the D.C. Circuit that &quot;the necessity
standard does not require a finding by the arbitrator and the [Board] that
the merger could not be effectuated without the specific changes that are
proposed for the petitioners' seniority rights and for the designation of
their home terminal.&quot; Id. at 10. Rather, it is sufficient if (1) &quot;some
transportation benefit flow[s] from the underlying transaction,&quot; and
(2) there is &quot;a nexus between the changes sought and the effectuation
of an approved transaction.&quot; Id. at 11. The court then found that the
arbitrator adequately demonstrated that the proposed agreement satisfied
those requirements, with respect to both the modification of seniority rights
and the relocation of the home terminal. Id. at 11-14.</P>

<P>ARGUMENT</P>

<P>The court of appeals' decision is consistent with decisions of this Court
and other circuits. Accordingly, petitioners' record-bound challenge to
the specific terms of their railway's merger agreement does not merit this
Court's review.</P>

<P>1. Petitioners argue (Pet. 11-18) that the court of appeals erred in
concluding that seniority rights may be modified as part of a merger agreement
because they are not the types of &quot;rights, privileges, and benefits&quot;
for which 49 U.S.C. 11326 (Supp. V 1999) and New York Dock require collective
bargaining. Petitioners, however, fail to identify any conflict with this
Court's prior decisions. To the contrary, the court of appeals' decision
is fully consistent with this Court's decision in Norfolk &amp; Western
Railway v. American Train Dispatchers' Ass'n, 499 U.S. 117 (1991), as evidenced
by the petition's reliance on the dissenting opinion in that case. See Pet.
11-12. In Norfolk, this Court held that the merging carriers' exemption
from &quot;all other law&quot; in 49 U.S.C. 11321(a) (Supp. V 1999), &quot;extends
to its legal obligations under a collective-bargaining agreement.&quot;
499 U.S. at 119. In so holding, the Court recognized that &quot;consolidations
in the public interest&quot; can result in, among other things, &quot;the
loss of seniority rights.&quot; Id. at 132-133.</P>

<P>Petitioners also fail to identify any conflict in the circuits. Quite
the opposite, the court of appeals here deliberately tracked the decision
of the only other court of appeals that has addressed the question-the D.C.
Circuit in United Transportation Union v. Surface Transportation Board,
108 F.3d 1425 (1997). See Pet. App. 8-9. In United Transportation Union,
the D.C. Circuit, like the court of appeals here (id. at 8), sustained the
Board's conclusion that &quot;rights, privileges, and benefits&quot; are
those collective &quot;incidents of employment, ancillary emoluments or
fringe benefits&quot; like life insurance, medical care, and sick leave,
but do not extend to such individualized concerns as seniority. See 108
F.3d at 1429-1430. Indeed, the D.C. Circuit concluded that the Board's interpretation
&quot;is exactly what was intended by Congress.&quot; Id. at 1430.</P>

<P>Petitioners' alternative focus (Pet. 12-16) on seniority rights as protected
&quot;rates of pay, rules, working conditions&quot; fares no better. That
argument was not addressed by the court of appeals. See Pet. App. 7 (&quot;[Petitioners]
argue, seniority rights are 'rights, privileges, and benefits.'&quot;).
Indeed, petitioners agree (Pet. 5-6) that their argument below focused on
the &quot;rights, privileges, and benefits&quot; language, rather than the
&quot;rates of pay, rules, working conditions&quot; terminology on which
they now rely. Moreover, petitioners' new argument has not been addressed
by any other court of appeals, so a grant of certiorari to address it here
would be both inappropriate and premature.</P>

<P>Finally, petitioners' argument fails to come to grips with the substantial
deference owed to the Board's construction of ambiguous statutory language
and its interpretation of the scope of the New York Dock protections. See,
e.g., Barnhart v. Walton, No. 00-1937 (Mar. 27, 2002), slip op. 9.</P>

<P>2. Petitioners also contend (Pet. 18-29) that the court of appeals erred
in holding that the modification of seniority rights and relocation of the
home terminal were &quot;necessary&quot; to effectuate the merger in a sensible
and efficient manner. Again, however, petitioners identify no inconsistency
between the court of appeals' ruling and the decision of this Court in Norfolk,
supra, or the decisions of other circuits. To the contrary, the court's
analysis echoed the D.C. Circuit's resolution of the same question in United
Transportation Union. There, the D.C. Circuit, like the court of appeals
here (Pet. App. 10-12), ruled that the necessity standard requires only
a nexus between the proposed changes and the public benefits arising from
the merger. See 108 F.3d at 1430-1431; see also Railway Labor Exec. Ass'n
v. United States, 987 F.2d 806, 815 (D.C. Cir. 1993).</P>

<P>The dearth of additional circuit court authority evidences the infrequency
with which this issue arises-a point that petitioners acknowledge (Pet.
21). That factor further weighs against an exercise of this Court's certiorari
jurisdiction.</P>

<P>Finally, petitioners' argument confessedly reduces to a record-bound
challenge to the &quot;application of facts to law.&quot; Pet. 25; see Pet.
App. 24 (Board characterizes argument as a challenge to arbitrator's factual
findings). This Court, however, does not sit to review the particularized
application of law to facts in individual cases.</P>

<P>CONCLUSION</P>

<P>The petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.</P>

<P>1 Prior to the 1995 Act terminating the Interstate Commerce Commission,
Pub. L. No. 104-88, 109 Stat. 803, this provision was codified at 49 U.S.C.
11341(a).</P>

<P>2 Prior to the 1995 Act terminating the Interstate Commerce Commission,
this provision was codified at 49 U.S.C. 11347.</P>

<P>3 Petitioners' request for a stay was denied. The Salina Hub was implemented
on May 1, 1999, and thus has now been in operation for almost three years.
