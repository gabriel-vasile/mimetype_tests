<meta name="dc.title" content=" - The Creative Class: A Key to Rural Growth - Amber Waves April 2007">
<meta name="dc.description" content="The creative class thesis-that towns need to attract engineers, architects, artists, and people in other creative occupations to compete in today's economy-may be particularly relevant to rural communities, which tend to lose much of their talent when young adults leave for college, the Armed Forces, or city lights.  The creative class lives mostly in urban settings, but is also found in rural areas with mountains, lakes, and other rural amenities. Nonmetro counties, with higher proportions of people in creative class  occupations tended to have higher rates of patent formation and manufacturing technology adoption in the 1990s-and higher rates of job growth in 1990-2004.">

                              Florida focuses on people, arguing that the knowledge

                              not lead to local economic dynamism as graduates 
                              may move to more attractive places upon obtaining

                              growth is to attract and retain talent, as talent 
                              leads to further job creation. </p>

                            <p align="justify">While developed with major metropolitan 
                              areas in mind, the creative-class thesis seems particularly 
                              relevant to rural areas, which lose much of their 
                              young talent as high school graduates leave, usually 
                              for highly urban environments. These rural areas, 
                              especially, need to attract talented young families, 
                              midlife career changers, active retirees, and others 
                              to maintain their talent base and thereby their 
                              economies. Given that rural earnings tend to be 
                              lower than urban earnings, especially for those 
                              with a college degree, rural quality of life would 
                              seem an essential part of that attraction.</p>
                            <p align="justify"> <strong>Where Is the Creative 
                              Class? </strong></p>
                            <p align="justify"> The creative class is predominately 
                              urban. In both 1990 and 2000, two-thirds of the 
                              &#8220;creative-class counties,&#8221; those ranking 
                              in the top quarter in the proportion or residents 
                              employed in creative-class occupations, were metropolitan 
                              even though nonmetropolitan counties are twice as 
                              numerous. Metropolitan creative-class counties are 
                              found across the country, but especially in the 
                              major urban areas.</p>
                            <p align="justify"> In 2000 (as in 1990), about 260 
                              or 11 percent of nonmetro counties ranked as creative-class 
                              counties. Regional differences are more pronounced 
                              than with metro creative-class counties; New England 
                              and the mountain areas of the West have higher shares 
                              of rural creative-class-counties than the Midwest 
                              and South. Consistent with the thesis that quality-of-life 
                              considerations strongly motivate the creative class, 
                              counties high in natural amenities are most likely 
                              to be creative-class magnets. Pitkin County, Colorado 
                              (which contains Aspen), for example, had the largest 
                              creative-class proportion of all nonmetro counties 
                              in both 1990 and 2000. </p>
                            <p align="justify"> Counties dominated by colleges 
                              and universities also ranked high in creative-class 
                              proportions. Tompkins County, New York, for example, 
                              has Cornell University. Jefferson County, Iowa, 
                              a Midwestern creative-class magnet, is home to Maharishi 
                              International University. As a draw for Transcendental 
                              Meditation adherents, the county has attracted many 
                              urban professionals who have started or work for 
                              more than 100 software development and professional 
                              service firms located there. Most of the nonmetro 
                              creative-class counties in low natural-amenity areas 
                              have colleges or universities. </p>
                            <p align="justify"> Mountain landscapes and universities 
                              are not required to attract the creative class to 
                              rural areas. Llano County does not contain a large 
                              college or university but is in the Texas Hill Country 
                              near Austin and borders on two large lakes. Robust 
                              growth in the number of artists in the county during 
                              the 1990s is representative of &#8220;artistic havens&#8221; 
                              emerging in select rural counties. Cook County, 
                              Minnesota, is a hiking and canoeing area, but it 
                              also has the oldest active artist colony in Minnesota. 
                              With a playhouse and a music association, it is 
                              where &#8220;culture merges with woods and water&#8221; 
                              (Grand Marais Chamber of Commerce). </p>

                              Class Show More Creativity?</strong></p>
                            <p align="justify"> A critical link in the creative-class 
                              argument is that places with a higher concentration 
                              of creative occupations actually have more creative 
                              activities. One often-used measure of local creativity 
                              is the ratio of patents to employment or population. 
                              The 1990s patent rate (number of patents in 1990-99 
                              per 1,000 employed in 1990) was, on average, much 
                              higher in metro (4.9) than nonmetro counties (1.7)&#8212;not 
                              surprising given the urban location of research 
                              universities and R&amp;D activities. However, within 
                              nonmetro areas, the average patent rate was twice 
                              as high in creative-class counties (3.3) as in other 
                              counties (1.5). Creative-class counties tended to 
                              generate more patents whether or not universities 
                              were present. Thus, while the aforementioned Tompkins 
                              and Jefferson Counties were in the top quarter of 
                              all counties ranked by patent rate, so were Llano 
                              and Pitkin Counties (although not Cook County). 
                            </p>
                            <p align="justify"> The adoption of new technologies 
                              and ideas is a natural spinoff of knowledge and 
                              creativity. Rural economies have few firms making 
                              high-tech products, but the incorporation of these 
                              products in production and communications is important 
                              for competitiveness. While no economy-wide indicators 
                              of adoption are available, the 1996 ERS Manufacturing 
                              Survey measured the adoption of advanced production 
                              and information technologies and new management 
                              practices. A scale of 16 adoption items&#8212;ranging 
                              from computer-assisted design to satellite communications 
                              to self-directed work teams&#8212;indicates advanced 
                              technology use. Those establishments using nine 
                              or more practices were considered &#8220;high adopters.&#8221; 
                              Branch plants aside (their technology use is likely 
                              to be influenced by their headquarters), establishments 
                              in nonmetro creative-class counties were more likely 
                              to be high adopters (20 percent) than establishments 
                              in other nonmetro locations (15 percent). Creative-class 
                              presence also made a difference in metro counties.</p>
                            <p align="justify"> Counties with high proportions 
                              of creative-class residents appear to have more 
                              creative activity with regard to patents and technology 
                              adoption. It is not clear, however, if this simply 
                              reflects self-selection (that is, people who invent 
                              and/or adopt new technologies and practices may 
                              tend to locate in high-amenity, creative-class settings) 
                              or if high creative-class environments engender 
                              more patenting and technology adoption. </p>

                            <p align="justify"> The creative class was highly 
                              associated with growth in rural areas in 1990-2004. 
                              Other nonmetro counties grew relatively slowly in 
                              the 1990s, but creative-class nonmetro counties 
                              tended to gain jobs over the period at a faster 
                              rate than their metro counterparts. </p>
                            <p align="justify"> While rural creative-class counties 
                              may grow because of the presence of the creative 
                              class, it is possible that the amenities that attracted 
                              the creative class were responsible for the higher 
                              job growth in creative-class counties in the 1990s. 
                              However, whether considering high-amenity, recreation, 
                              high-education, or other attributes, counties with 
                              a high proportion of creative-class residents generally 
                              had job growth rates that were twice as high as 
                              counties with less creative class presence. </p>
                            <p align="justify"> A larger ERS analysis, which included 
                              2,145 nonmetro counties in the 48 contiguous States, 
                              took into account a number of other possible influences 
                              on the location of the creative class and its relationship 
                              with rural growth during the 1990s. The analysis 
                              included measures of landscape and climate, settlement 
                              density and commuting, industry structure (farming, 
                              mining, manufacturing, business services, and recreation),

                              job growth in the surrounding counties. This analysis 
                              found that both the level and change in the creative 
                              class were linked directly to job growth. </p>
                            <p align="justify"> The presence of the creative class 
                              may itself create amenities. For instance, a place 
                              that has attracted artists and designers may appeal 
                              to people who like artistic communities. And, the

                              to a community by the restaurants, stores, and other 
                              consumer services that develop in response to the 
                              consumption patterns of the creative class. However, 
                              ERS analysis showed that both the 1990 creative-class 
                              proportion and the 1990-2000 creative-class growth 
                              were more highly related to job growth than population 
                              increases during the 1990s, suggesting that the 
                              central influence of the creative class is a more 
                              effective use of local resources and opportunities 
                              and hence greater growth in jobs, which facilitates 
                              population growth.</p>
                            <p align="justify"> The creative-class analysis suggests 
                              that rural growth depends greatly on the attractiveness 
                              of rural communities, their landscapes, and their 
                              climates. Visits to websites of chambers of commerce 
                              and local development organizations in rural areas 
                              show that many rural communities are advertising 
                              their quality-of-life amenities to prospective businesses 
                              and residents. However, economic evaluations of 
                              the impact of public and private investments on 
                              growth still rarely consider quality-of-life factors. 
                              The creative-class study suggests rural growth impacts 
                              cannot be understood without taking these factors

                              and residents, but rural areas tend to have the

                                  <p align="justify">Richard Florida&#8217;s measure 
                                    of creative class, discussed in his book, 
                                    The Rise of the Creative Class, included occupations 
                                    that he judged to entail high levels of creativity. 
                                    In practice, this turned out to be virtually 
                                    all occupations where incumbents tend to have 
                                    high levels of schooling. ERS analysts refined 
                                    the creative class measure in two ways. First, 
                                    they used O*NET, a Bureau of Labor Statistics 
                                    data set on skills generally used in occupations, 
                                    to identify occupations in Florida&#8217;s 
                                    list that typically involve &#8220;thinking 
                                    creatively.&#8221; This skill element is defined 
                                    as &#8220;developing, designing, or creating 
                                    new applications, ideas, relationships, systems, 
                                    or products, including artistic contributions.&#8221; 
                                  </p>
                                  <p align="justify"> Second, the analysts screened 
                                    out as many occupations as possible that typically 
                                    require high levels of creativity (such as 
                                    schoolteachers, judges, and medical doctors) 
                                    but whose numbers are proportional to the 
                                    residential population they serve. These refinements 
                                    resulted in an estimated creative class share 
                                    of the workforce of 21 percent in 1990 (23 
                                    percent in metro areas and 14 percent in nonmetro 
                                    areas), a much smaller share than the 30 percent 
                                    found using Florida&#8217;s original measure. 
                                    While by no means perfect, the amended measure 
                                    is closer than Florida&#8217;s original measure 
                                    to the <br>

                                    Florida&#8217;s original measure, 1990-2004 
                                    job growth in nonmetro creative class counties 
                                    was 30 percent, much lower than the 44 percent
