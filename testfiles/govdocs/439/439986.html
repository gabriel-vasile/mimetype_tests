<h1> Avascular Tumor Growth </h1>

<i> with Jim Freyer, Jelena Pjesivac, Charles Cantrell, Kevin Flores,
Zhiying Sun, Kejing He
</i>
<p>
The microenvironment inside a tumor is extremely complex and adaptive,
involving spatial and temporal variations in nutrient and waste
gradients, cellular physiology, metabolism, the expression patterns of
genes and proteins as well as the malignant progression. The sum of
all these elements defines the response of a tumor to treatment. The
multicellular tumor spheroid system has been a primary example of in
vitro models of the tumor microenvironment, which has provided
numerous insights into tumor dynamics and progression. We develop a
multiscale model to study spheroid tumor growth, which includes at the
subcellular level a protein expression network that controls the
possibility for cell cycle arrest, and at the cellular level a hybrid
of cellular dynamics (lattice Monte Carlo) and reaction-diffusion
dynamics of chemicals (PDEs). This integrated subcellular and cellular
model provides a realistic representation of both structure and
dynamics over a large range of time and length scales. Our simulations
show favorable comparisons with spheroid experiments. The combination
of a data-rich experimental system with sophisticated mathematical
modeling holds the promise of an improved basic understanding of
malignant progression and therapeutic response in humans.

<h1> Angiogenesis  </h1>
<i> with Amy Bauer, Trachette Jackson </i>
<p>
Tumor-induced angiogenesis is the formation of new blood
vessels from existing vasculature in response to chemical
signals from a tumor. Angiogenesis marks the pivotal transition
from benign solid tumor growth to vascular growth,
a more progressive and potentially fatal stage of cancer
beyond which cancer becomes extremely difficult to treat,
existing therapies become ineffective and survival rates
decrease. Angiogenesis is a complex process, involving
multiple time scales and intricate interplay between biochemical
and biomechanical mechanisms, including cell-cell
and cell-matrix interactions, cell surface receptor binding,
and intracellular signaling pathways. The sequential morphogenetic
processes required for angiogenesis to occur are
well known and a review of these follows; however, what is
still not completely understood is how cellular and molecular
mechanisms are coordinated to control these processes. We develop a
cell-based, multiscale modeling framework of 
tumor-induced angiogenesis designed to address these questions
of mechanism. An understanding of the principal
underpinnings driving angiogenic processes will advance
efforts aimed at the development of new therapies for treating
cancer and other angiogenesis-dependent diseases.

<h1> Vascular Tumor Growth and Chemotherapy </h1>
<i> with Lesette De Pillis </i>
<p>

Chemotherapy is one of the most commonly used methods of cancer
treatment, but most forms of chemotherapy are extremely toxic and take
a heavy toll on the health of the patient. This is because many
standard forms of chemotherapy target and kill cells in the process of
division, an approach that destroys non-cancerous cells as
well. Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy suffer from hair-loss
and compromised immune systems because both involves rapidly dividing
cells. Still the full effects of chemotherapy are not completely
udnerstood.  By creating a better model of tumors, tumor growth, and
the effects of chemotherapy upon such tumors, we hope to better
understand tumor growth mechanisms and imporve treatments for cancer.

During the semester from 9/05 to 5/06, a team of very talented
undergrad students (Math Clinic) from Harvey Mudd College worked under
the guidance of Lisette De Pillis, and modeled vascular tumor growth
and chemotherapy. The team extended our avascular tumor model to
include vasculature. The vascular tumor model simulated chemothreapy
treatments using cyclophosphamide, a non-cell cycle specific
anti-cancer drug.
